It is designated as closed game content.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Geography</span></h1><p>AiR p.315</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan is a massive realm with a wide variety of topographies: vast swaths of striking coastline, plains of waving grass, high mountains, and deep, primordial forests. A map of the whole of Rokugan can be found in the introduction, on page 13.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Coast</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Rokugani people have built villages, towns, and cities on the more accessible sections of the coast to facilitate farming, fishing, trading, and travel. The rest of the coast—the cliffs, crags, and crumbling shorelines—presents far more dangers than boons and remains isolated. The coastal lands of the north tend to be rocky, from their sheer cliffs to their beaches of stones. The massive cliffs, cold and blustery winds, and roar of the chilly ocean can give even the most stoic monk pause, as the elements whip and churn around them. As a traveler moves south, the coast becomes flatter and more pleasant due to the warmer currents. With calm winds, temperate weather, and soft, sandy beaches, these coastal areas elicit tranquility and contemplation.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Forests</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Among the forest birdsong and sighs of cicadas are echoes resonating from other realms. Ethereal forms dart about in the periphery of perception beneath the shifting canopy’s shadows. Even in the absence of sounds, one can hear a forest breathe. Forests are living beings, each with its own unique temperament. The Shinomen Forest, the Kitsune Forest, and several other massive, ancient forests are well-known spiritual locations in Rokugan. Anyone would be a fool to enter such a woodland without first learning its rules.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Plains</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Much of central Rokugan is covered by sweeping plains. These regions are fertile farmlands, filled with villages that produce the majority of Rokugan’s food. Crisscrossed with rivers and broken periodically by rolling hills, Rokugan’s heartland is a stunning sight. From a hilltop or castle wall, one can see over vast distances, tracking storms for hours as they approach. In times of war, it is not storms but armies that wrack the land, for the value of this farmland has made it contested ground many times over the centuries by the Great Clans.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Mountains</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The mountains of Rokugan limn the horizon, whispering of a tumultuous age when the ground heaved upward until stone met sky. Once bringers of catastrophic change, they are now slumbering giants, insurmountable by even the ocean’s winds. Their chaotic forms create expansive walls, defining the borders of Rokugan and its internal territories, but they are far more than just barriers. The Spine of the World Mountains cut across Rokugan, creating a natural barrier between north and south, while the Great Northern Mountains and Twilight Mountains set the boundaries of Rokugan’s domain.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Ruins</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Ruins never truly die. They hold the memories of their previous lives and the anguish of their decay. These memories infuse ruins with distinct personalities. Stone ruins, leftovers from castles or noble estates, stand proud despite their disrepair. What remains of a crumbling structure provides a landmark for travelers and a refuge against wind and rain. The oldest of ruins tend to be packed-earth structures or burial mounds, the simplest of construction, almost indistinguishable from any natural structure. Few such burial mounds remain, however, for many were defiled by Iuchiban during his war on Rokugan or by the Bloodspeaker cultists he inspired in the years since.</span></p>",

The further south one travels, the more the grip of the Shadowlands can be felt upon the land. The Crab Clan’s lands end at the Carpenter Wall, from the towering heights of which it feels one can peer into the abyss itself.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Hida Family</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As a traveler approaches the Carpenter Wall, the lands steadily grow rockier and drier. Once the rice paddies grow rare and the ground becomes marred with the crushing footfalls of repeated marches, one has entered the Hida family’s domain. The harsh landscape reflects the grim attitude of its ruling family. Visitors from the other Great Clans are rare and when they do show up, they are regarded with suspicion and considered liabilities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Whether samurai or commoner, almost everyone in the region has a nightmarish story of a hungry monster in the night, a bloody mist that stole away dozens of villagers, or another horror more unspeakable still. Some of these stories draw to a close tragically, but many end with the arrival of a Hida champion who drives back the night once again.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Hida Palace</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Hida Palace is easily the most fortified palace in Rokugan. Its thick stone walls tower over 180 feet high, their rough surfaces lined with the latest Kaiu war machines. Giant gates partition the outer walls into a series of kill zones intended to corral invaders. Pulsing through the air are the beats of taiko drums directing the marches of practicing troops. Many soldiers wear heavy armor and grim expressions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The most striking feature of this palace is mounted above its main entrance—the skull of the Maw, an ancient demon from Rokugan’s past grinning out threateningly at all who arrive. The interior of the palace is austere, its only decorations being the banners of the Crab families. Within these halls, adventurers can seek permission from the Clan Champion Hida Kisada to enter the Shadowlands. However, visitors should beware: Hida Kisada is known to hate those who seek glory with no greater purpose.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sanctuary Rock Garden</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The constant state of warfare leaves many among the Crab Clan in need of mental, physical, and spiritual healing. To help its soldiers, Crab Clan healers have created Sanctuary Rock Garden, where traumatized soldiers have access to proper care, guidance, and peaceful meditation spaces so they can recover as much as possible from the horrors of their pasts and graduate to safer and more mundane environments and professions as far away from the Shadowlands as the northern border of Crab land allows.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Landless Hiruma</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Beyond the Wall, in the foothills of the Twilight Mountains, Daylight Castle waits. Shadowlands beasts crawl through its halls, defiling the majestic fortress. Claw marks scar the stone. Bones litter the floor. All is dark and putrid. According to the tales, though, within is Candle Temple, radiating with a divine light. It is a shining beacon calling out to the family for which it burns. Under its guardianship, the last surviving remnants of Hiruma history wait to be reclaimed.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">For more on Daylight Castle, see <strong>A Grim Inheritance</strong> on page 354.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Cherry Blossom Snow Village</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Far to the north remains one of the few towns still overseen by the Hiruma. Cherry Blossom Snow Village is a place unscarred by war, and Hiruma scouts in need of rest and recovery are sometimes sent there for a time as administrators to be reminded of what it is that their efforts protect. This “village” is nearly the size of the city, and its major export is lumber harvested from the fringe of the Shinomen Forest. However, it is most famous for the ethereal scene of its cherry trees dropping petals across the icy lake that sits at the heart of the town each spring.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Kaiu</span></h2><p>AiR p.318</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Compared with much of Crab territory, the provinces of the Kaiu are pastoral and calm. Commoners farm safely behind the Kaiu’s meticulously maintained sections of the Carpenter Wall. The only interruption of the peaceful ambiance comes with the occasional, if noisy, testing of new war engines. Even then, the Kaiu’s citizens find comfort in hearing the family’s siege engines smashing hills into bits. Most visitors to the Kaiu lands are either traders avoiding Shinomen Forest on their way to various mountain passes or warriors in search of masterwork Kaiu weapons.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Carpenter Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Carpenter Castle, also known as Kaiu Castle, predates and adjoins the Wall. Within its seamless stone facade, master smiths and engineers build the Crab Clan’s future. The interior of Carpenter Castle is almost entirely mechanized. It has platforms that rise and lower via groups of clever pulleys and counterweights, gear-propelled conveyor belts made of reed mats, a complex alarm system, lever-operated gates. In the entrance hall stands a famous music box boasting a wide selection of twinkling songs. All of this wonder seems taken for granted by the bustling engineering students, whose pockets overflow with scales, templates, and rolls of schematic-covered paper. Their quiet discussions fill the wide rooms with a soft hum, creating a contemplative atmosphere. Outside, everything is much louder. Prototype war engines line the Carpenter Wall and unleash destruction on the Twilight Mountains beyond. There are nooks along the walkway where teachers and their pupils can duck in case of a machine’s failure.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Face of the East Castle and Golden Carp Marketplace</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Golden Carp Marketplace lies at the base of the Kaiu family’s Face of the East Castle. There, the Unicorn and Crab engage in trade. While much of the market is legitimate, it also hides a thriving underbelly, one of the largest forbidden markets in all of Rokugan. Criminals conduct their business unnoticed, or even encouraged when it results in access to critical supplies that would otherwise be unavailable. The constant flow of merchants allows illegal items to slip through the Golden Carp Marketplace with ease. Smugglers employ the desperate to pick over Crab battlefields, recovering and selling everything from common weapons to priceless heirlooms. A samurai looking to outfit themself with Kaiu weapons can either purchase them at this market or seek them via even less legitimate means.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Razor of the Dawn Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A fortress rarely attacked by Shadowlands horrors, Razor of the Dawn Castle is in a naturally defensible position between two rocky hills. This makes it an excellent staging ground for ventures into the Shadowlands. Its proximity to both the Shinomen Forest and the lands of the Falcon Clan also make it a place where the Phantom Hunters of that clan and the skilled monster hunters of the Crab Clan often confer and collaborate on particularly difficult tasks.</span></p><blockquote><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>The Sorcerer’s Disciples</em></span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Iuchiban was a heretical sorcerer who twice brought the Empire to its knees, unleashing the scourge of the undead upon Rokugan. The second time his forces marshalled, many of his disciples rallied in the Twilight Mountains, striking from the northern reaches of these mountains.

Plants withered, water became foul, and ritualists lost contact with the spirits. The Kuni began to evacuate and cleared out their invaluable libraries just before hordes of Shadowlands creatures clawed out of the ground. This subterranean army was tunneling into the heart of Rokugan, led by an oni named the Witch of Calamity. The oni’s apparent defeat came due to the ingenuity of the Kaiu. Combat engineers diverted aquifers, collapsed tunnels, and invented brutal traps and machines. The Kuni blasted the oni’s vile influence from the land with devastating magic, rendering it a vast wasteland. Yet many of the tunnels beneath the land are still filled with horrors, and the Kuni periodically venture into these terrifying, claustrophobic pits to smite the evils that lie within. Some of these tunnels are said to spread as far as the Shinomen Forest, and many purifiers fear that fragments of the Witch of Calamity’s power are coalescing to threaten this sylvan realm even today.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Castle of the Earth</span></h3><p>AiR p.319</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Every Crab castle is a near-impenetrable fortress, and the comparatively small seat of the Kuni family is no exception. The barracks filled with loud guards surround the castle, but rarely, if ever, do they go in. The dark halls are nearly abandoned save for a few archivists. The castle appears to be completely empty, for the Kuni laboratories and library are hidden underground. Outsiders are not permitted to browse the Kuni’s research without permission from Kuni Yori, the imposing lord of the castle. However, once a year at the winter solstice, the castle hosts the Kuni Symposium. Purifiers return from their country-wide trek to join their family and a few select guests from other clans, and other mystics who have emerged from their lairs. The event is filled with displays of anatomical charts of clawed and tentacled horrors, preserved body parts such as monstrous fangs and strange organs in jars, artifacts brimming with the power of the Shadowlands, translations of texts from faraway lands or ancient ruins, crystals, amulets, and revised systems of wards.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Yasuki</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In the centuries since they left the Crane Clan and joined the Crab Clan, the Yasuki have transformed the sleepy fishing villages of Earthquake Fish Bay into exuberant centers of entertainment and commerce. It is their mission to fund the Crab’s war against the Shadowlands, and they work to accomplish this goal by any means necessary. However, the Yasuki face another challenge here: the family’s bad blood with the Crane Clan has made it the frequent target of some of the most powerful political figures in Rokugan for over five centuries. To stay one step ahead of the Crane Clan, the Yasuki family has had to forge ties with pirates, criminals, and others who operate outside of the law.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Friendly Traveler Village</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Friendly Traveler Village is rightly called the sake capital of Rokugan. Nearly every other building is a brewery, each with its own special brews and promotions. The local theaters have a popular appeal, performing crude comedies and music that is easy to sing along to while intoxicated. At night, the village is lit with hundreds of paper lanterns, leading the intoxicated to their beds or at least to a comfortable patch of grass. Friendly Traveler Village also hosts a large criminal contingent, and is raided often by Emerald Magistrates, frequently at the behest of members of the Crane Clan within that organization.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Yasuki Estates</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The cliffside estates of the Yasuki are masterpieces of architecture. These cliffside mansions elegantly nestle into the rock face like nesting seabirds, safe and comfortable above the gently lapping seas overlooking Earthquake Fish Bay. Below, long grids of docks harbor a fleet of merchant ships. Visitors disembarking their vessels traverse the pale maple planks to a winding road. Merchants flock to the Yasuki Estates, as do treasure seekers. Many rare items pass through Yasuki hands, after all. The Yasuki also deal in information; if they do not have what someone wants, they likely know someone who does.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Carpenter Wall</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While it is not a domain unto itself, nearly anyone traveling in Crab lands will feel the presence of the Carpenter Wall. Hida Palace is built into this massive structure, as are the many watchtowers that serve as keeps along the Wall. Sophisticated systems of warning and communications are maintained along the Wall as well, and between the Wall and the forces stationed behind it. These include fleet-footed messengers; acoustic methods like signal arrows, drums, and horns; and visual methods such as signal fires and smoke arrows.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Kaiu Towers</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Foremost among the strongpoints are the twelve Towers. The southeasternmost of these is designated the First Tower; they are then successively numbered to the Twelfth Tower, which overlooks the Plains above Evil to the far northwest. Each tower is laid out in essentially the same way, with a stout outer stone wall, enclosing a number of courtyards connected by strong gates. An enemy that breaches the outer stone walls is contained in a courtyard and subject to attack from the surrounding ones, making each of these into a killing zone. The innermost wall contains the keep, the last line of defense for a tower. The keep is itself a formidable fortress, well provisioned in order to withstand a lengthy siege. Massive gates allow large forces to exit a tower to charge enemies as well.</span></p><blockquote><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Life on the Wall</em></span></h2><p><em>AiR p.320</em></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Life on the Wall, or in the armies stationed behind it, is difficult, stressful, and dangerous in a way that most Rokugani really can’t appreciate without experiencing it themselves. Crab forces must live in a state of constant readiness, forever poised to launch themselves against foes that personify mind-blasting horror.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>For at least one week out of every four, however, the defenders are rotated. They are either moved into a “depth” position behind the Wall or, very infrequently, briefly paused from their duty. Soldiers on respite get drunk; play games such as Fortunes and Winds (a popular dice game), moksha patam (a board game imported from the Ivory Kingdoms), and draw-lot plays (a social game of portraying characters); and often engage in the popular Crab Clan pastime of brawling.</em></span></p></blockquote><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Watchtowers</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Interspersed along the Wall between the Kaiu Towers are a multitude of smaller watchtowers. Each of these is garrisoned by a company led by a captain; lesser watchtowers contain squads commanded by a sergeant. A group of three to five watchtowers, often called a Great Watch, has one of these commanders (normally a senior captain) as its overall commander, who reports to the nearest Kaiu Tower. Watchtowers are officially designated based on the Tower to their south and east. For example, the first watchtower west and north of the Fourth Kaiu Tower is the First of the Fourth Watchtower; the next along is the Second of the Fourth Watchtower, and so on. The towers also have more poetic names used by their inhabitants.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Curtain Walls</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The curtain walls that connect the watchtowers and the Kaiu Towers are what most Rokugani envision when they think of “the Wall.” These are, indeed, imposing structures—from fifty to one hundred feet tall, up to twenty feet thick and extending deep into the bedrock. Most citizens of Rokugan imagine these massive walls being constantly lined with Crab troops, but the truth is more complicated. While the Crab Clan does make a determined effort to hold threatened sections of the curtain wall, its strategists know that a single, linear defense is simply too fragile to be reliable. Accordingly, the main purpose of the curtain wall is to delay attackers, letting the Crab Clan maneuver forces behind the Wall in order to block and destroy incursions.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Tunnels</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The weakest point in any defensive work is a passage through it, such as a gate. Each of the Kaiu Towers incorporates a massive and heavily defended gate, but these are not the only ways into and out of the Shadowlands. To allow for the much more frequent access by smaller forces, such as patrols and scouting parties, elaborate systems of tunnels are constructed to allow passage under the Wall’s defenses. Some are dug for specific purposes and collapsed when they are no longer needed. Other, more permanent complexes are protected by cunning and deadly traps, small parties of dedicated defenders, or their twisting, labyrinthine nature. The local nezumi are instrumental in the construction and maintenance of these vital passages.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Garrisons</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The sheer size of the Wall means garrisoning at full strength along its length is impossible, so large cadres are maintained at the Kaiu Towers, with smaller forces stationed at intervening watchtowers. Unless an attack is imminent or underway, most sections of the curtain wall are only patrolled at irregular and unpredictable intervals. The bulk of Crab forces are stationed behind the Wall, encamped at places such as Carpenter Castle, Castle of the Earth, or Hida Palace. This allows them to quickly deploy to reinforce sections of the Wall or block and destroy incursions that breach it.</span></p><blockquote><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Combat on the Wall</em></span></h2><p><em>AiR p.320</em></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>No two attacks from the Shadowlands are the same. One may consist of a ravenous swarm of giant insects that advance toward defenses with chaotic abandon. The next may be a horde of undead shambling forward in eerie silence, and the next an incursion by shapeshifting oni seeking to infiltrate the defenses and attack them from within. Ultimately, the nature of the Shadowlands is such that attacks are predictable only in their unpredictability. To deal with these myriad horrors, the Crab Clan meets each attack according to its particular nature with an adaptable defensive mindset.</em></span></p></blockquote><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Location Spotlight: The Watchtower of Iron Duty</span></h2><p>AiR p.322</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Each watchtower is a formidable strongpoint, equipped with siege engines and other weaponry, somewhat like a scaled-down tower. However, their primary purpose is surveillance and warning. They are neither designed nor provisioned to withstand a protracted siege, being expected to hold for only a few days at most. The Watchtower of Iron Duty is one such site, famous for the heroics of its garrison in holding out for a full week during the invasion of The Maw. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Key Places </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The following are the key locations of the Watchtower of Iron Duty. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Armory</strong>.

The ancestral Crane lands stretch along the eastern territories of Rokugan, and Crane lands account for seventy percent of its coastline, encompassing rocky cliffs, offshore island clusters, deep bays, and serene, pale beaches. Rivers carve valleys through the ancient mountain range dividing the lands into northern and southern provinces. Abundant with rice paddies in the floodplains, docks and fishing villages on the coast, and rich orchards around palatial estates, Crane lands are considered to be the breadbasket of the Empire.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands oF the Doji</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Doji family directly rules over the largest portion of Crane lands, overseeing the pastoral provinces that generate much of the Emerald Empire’s wealth. However, the family’s main estate of Doji Palace is actually much further north, to better access the Imperial Court. This physical distance between the highly influential cultural center to the north and the more rural but no less vital provinces to the south can make assignments to the outskirts of Doji lands seem like a punishment, as it puts a samurai far from the wheels of political power.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Doji Palace</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Also called the Esteemed Palaces of the Crane, Doji Palace is a set of estates designed for aesthetic beauty, and is one of the most common host locations for the yearly Winter Court.

Yet the seclusion of this untouched wood shelters one of the Doji’s most important cities. The Quiet City, as it is called, is the home of the illustrious Doji Academy, where students train in courtly arts, political theory, and diplomatic etiquette. Built around the academy with the transient student population in mind, it boasts a few distractions from daily life, such as a theater, a park, and some restaurants, as well as a vibrant nightlife in spite of its size. The predominant shrines include a shrine to the Fortune of Romantic Love and one to Doji Nio, Lady Doji’s second son.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands oF the Asahina</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Asahina rule the southernmost portion of the Crane Clan’s lands, abutting the lands of the Yasuki.

This is vital, as the Daidoji must be able to reach any Crane province quickly to offer a swift defense if needed.

The Kakita’s lands are also the nearest to those of the Matsu of the Lion Clan, which has certainly not helped the ancient grudge between the Kakita and the Matsu that dates back to their founders’ dramatic duel. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Kakita Palace and the Dueling Academy </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The most renowned duelists of the Emerald Empire are trained in the Kakita Dueling Academy. Located inside of Kakita Palace, the facility features training grounds, texts on theory and meditation, and no shortage of skilled opponents against whom to practice. The Kakita tradition focuses on mastery of a single strike—iaijutsu, or the draw-cut—and there is no better place to study this martial style than here. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Seven Fold Palace </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Seven Fold Palace is an architectural marvel, thanks to the influence of the castle architects who train and practice there. Every detail of the campus, from the joinery used to create the wooden fixtures to the quality of the food served to guests, is an experiment in crafting excellence. From blacksmithing to origami to cuisine, many arts are practiced here. The Seven Fold Palace’s occupants are divided into apprentices, journeymen, and masters. On the masters’ council sits one master of each craft: a master swordsmith, a master koto maker, a master armorer, a master architect, and several dozen others. It can take decades of study to reach the rank of journeyman, and only a rare few achieve the rank of master.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Location Spotlight: The Port that Never Sleeps</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Deep on the southern coast in the Crane lands sits the Port That Never Sleeps, an eclectic old port town pulled up from the silt and the driftwood. The harbor squats at the bottom of an old crater basin on the coast, tucked between two high, arching promontories. This “spilled cup” forms an easily defended natural harbor. The town spreads across the basin and up either side. The city tells its uncertain history in its winding alleys, its switchbacks, its dead ends, hovels, crooked streets and old, moldering houses. Yet in recent years, it has experienced an economic boom thanks to trade that comes in through the coastal islands, making its architecture an odd mix of opulence and decrepitude. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Port that Never Sleeps is the place to go if one is looking for a particular item, or wants to find passage on a ship up the coast or out to the Coastal Islands. The town magistrate has also offered some legal protections to rōnin and mercenary groups looking for work there, which means that plenty of swords for hire now call the city home. </span></p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZAZspKZ.png\" /><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Key Places </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The following are key places of The Port that Never Sleeps. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Kandai Castle</strong>. Kandai Castle rests high on the slopes over the bay, on the sharp northern promontory above the Port That Never Sleeps. There, it overlooks the water as though admiring its own reflection. Designed to evoke the eagerness of youth, it once stood proud and handsome; yet, while it is still quite young for a Rokugani castle, its towers have begun to show their age; the lacquer is decaying in the sun, and sparrows have nested in the gables. Yet the castle remains quite functional. The red-orange lacquer on Castle Kandai’s timbers hardens and fireproofs the wood, and the color helps mariners to see the outer towers from afar; many of the towers serve double duty as lighthouses. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Port Defenses (Submerged Chains).</strong> In order to protect the stability of their hub, the Crane have built watchtowers, established a guard patrol, and installed an unusual defense mechanism at the entrances to the bay: massive chains attached to either side of the harbor entrances that rest at the bottom of the sea until pulled taut. While taut, the chains are obscured just below the water and can scuttle any ship that tries to pass.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>The Docks</strong>. Paths cross and uncross at the unruly docks, where unexpected alignments and rivalries form. Crane courtiers charter sleazy mercenary boats to convene with pirates upriver. Children sell oysters by the sack and scramble before the buyers notice they’re mostly just wet rocks. Castle guards sneak out to the fighting rings just in time to place bets on their captain. Undercover magistrates investigate corrupt magistrates smuggling illegal goods. Veteran naval officers and mangy opportunist rōnin crews set sail from the harbor at midnight, racing for the same prize.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sleepless Nights</span></h2><p>AiR p.326</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Several powerful merchant families openly oppose Crane rule of the port, and friction has turned to flouting of the law and increasingly open resistance. The castle daimyō, Asahina Susumu, would delight to see the rebellious merchants arrested, fined, and imprisoned, and has assigned many magistrates to this effort. Unfortunately for Susumu, corruption runs rampant among the magistrates of the port, and progress has been glacial. The PCs might be hired by Susumu to bring in the rebellious merchants, hired by the merchants to send a message to Susumu, or even hired by both to deal with the other!</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Notable People of The Port that Never Sleeps</span></h3><p>AiR p.326</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The PCs might encounter one or more of the following NPCs in the city.

The lord of Kandai Castle and highest-ranking Crane Clan official of the city.

The chief magistrate tasked with enforcing the law in the city. Shinako is on the payroll of Seijun, who has her focus on hunting pirates rather than enforcing Crane laws upon the local merchant houses. Shinako is very dedicated to the status quo, which makes her job easy and keeps her pockets lined, but does earnestly try to solve serious crimes when they occur.

The head of the Open Sky merchant house, and speaker for all of the local merchant concerns. Seijun feels open conflict is bad for business, but wants to avoid greater legal restrictions being placed by Susumu (or anyone else). Can often be found in the Overlook Teahouse.

The youngest and most (in)famous fence in town. Whether this notoriety makes the ambitious eighteen-year-old the best or worst dealer of illicit goods is up to debate. Yubi will always take a quick payout over a long-term bet, and sides with whichever of the town’s movers and shakers offers the best incentive at the moment. Can often be found at the Shrine to the Fortune of Children paying local urchins for information. Uses the ruffian profile with the trickster template.</span></p>",

To many travelers, the mountains seem inhospitable, yet Togashi’s followers have carved out a place for themselves in this marginal environment. The crops and diet here are quite different than in other parts of Rokugan, with barley, oats, and animal products from goats and yaks making up an important part of the staples. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands of the Togashi </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Unlike other Great Clan families, the lands of the Togashi are not subdivided into provinces but constitute a single province. They sprawl across the desolate, forbidding mountains of the Great Northern Climb, largely inaccessible and almost wholly undeveloped. There are few roads, none of which are regularly maintained, and little arable land. The landscape is truly stark yet beautiful, barren rock shaped by volcanic eruptions, rushing rivers and spectacular waterfalls, and the patient chew of wind, water, and ice. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The High House of Light </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The High House of Light is the primary holding of the Togashi family, an imposing structure perched on a mountainside and reachable only by ascending an obscure path of one thousand steps. It is probably the most prominent temple in the Dragon lands, serving not only as a holy place, and a monastery for the Togashi family, but also as a fortress, a training facility, and the ancestral home of the Dragon Clan Champion. The members of the Togashi order who reside here pursue Enlightenment through meditation, contemplation of the world, study of the Teachings of Shinsei, pursuit of martial arts, and their enigmatic tasks to further Togashi’s vision. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Wisdom’s Overlook </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Built in the sixth century atop a high mountain peak north and east of the High House of Light, the shrine to the Fortune of Wisdom is likely the least resplendent shrine to a Great Fortune in the Empire. Visitors pass through a torii arch located near the base of the mountain, meaning that they must make a lengthy climb—emblematic of an arduous pilgrimage—to the shrine proper, a plain edifice of grey stone and black slate roofing tiles.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Tradition dictates that those who come here to worship the Fortune leave an offering of something made with their own hands. These gifts to the Fortune range from the simple and crude, to sublime masterpieces. Ironically, this makes the shrine a de facto museum and art exhibit containing what is likely the most complete cross-section of artistic achievement in the Empire. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Refuge of the Three Sisters</span></h3><p>AiR p.328</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Located in the mountains known as the Dragon’s Teeth, the Refuge of the Three Sisters is a rarity in Rokugan—a shrine devoted to Lord Moon. Visitors must brave an extremely difficult and dangerous ascent along a narrow, switch-back path known as the Climb to the Moon. Different accounts describe different shrines: after passing through a weather-beaten torii arch, some speak of a small stone hut, others a cave, and still others a grove of ancient pines. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Regardless of its particular nature, those who enter the shrine will find three women, the Sisters of the Moon. One is an adolescent girl, one a middle-aged woman, and the third a wrinkled matriarch, variously described as practicing various arts, such as music or painting. The Sisters will answer any question put to them but do so in riddles. Their answer is always true, but often leads to misfortune.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands of the Mirumoto</span></h2><p>AiR p.328</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In stark contrast to the rugged, desolate lands of the Togashi, those of the Mirumoto are far more hospitable, having much in common with the territories of the more southerly clans. Consisting of four provinces collectively known as the Lowlands, they extend south from the Great Northern Mountains, in rolling, hilly terrain only slightly more rugged than that of the Lion Clan to the south. The bulk of the clan’s samurai and commoners live here, in villages and towns similar to those that would be found in most other parts of Rokugan. Because few outsiders are allowed to proceed beyond these lands, and into the mountainous regions further north, it is in these Lowlands that the Dragon conduct most of their trade, commerce, and political interaction with the rest of the Empire. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Last Glance Castle </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Also known as Mirumoto Castle, this fortress is a stark and functional fortress built into the side of a mountain overlooking a steep, winding road ascending from the Lowlands below. The ancestral home of the Mirumoto daimyō, the castle is predominantly a fortress, intended to function as the headquarters of the Dragon army, as well as one of its main barracks. It is nowhere near as resplendent as the homes of family daimyō elsewhere in the Empire, which is why most political delegations are hosted in more accommodating locations, such as the city of Heibesu to the north, or Kitsuki Castle to the west. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Izaku’s Foresight </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Located on the eastern margin of the Dragon lands, on the edge of the Dragon Heart Plain, Izaku’s Foresight is named for the Dragon Clan vassal family that administrates it. The Izaku Library, the Izaku family’s great legacy, is located here, housing detailed lore related to agriculture and growing of crops. There are also several large temples here, including a particularly imposing temple devoted to the Fortune of Wealth. Finally, the Mirumoto maintain a strong garrison here, since Izaku’s Foresight is one of only a few approaches into Dragon lands from the east. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Iron Mountain Village and Dōjō </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Originally intended as the location of the Mirumoto family’s castle, Mirumoto’s first successor relocated his father’s castle to its more suitable, present location. This original foundation was used, instead, for the construction of Iron Mountain Dōjō. Since its construction, this facility has functioned as the training academy for most Dragon bushi, and is also considered the center of excellence for training, study, and refinement of the Niten style of dueling. A village has formed around this training ground over the centuries. As befits Mirumoto’s doctrine of flexible thinking, students are encouraged to pursue particular areas that interest them, rather than conforming to a rigid syllabus.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands of the Agasha</span></h2><p>AiR p.328</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The lands of the Agasha, known as The Twisting Labyrinth, are a complex sprawl of mountain ranges and peaks, and intervening valleys. Although not as rugged, desolate, and inhospitable as the lands of the Togashi to the north, the Agasha lands are still daunting to traverse and unforgiving of those not prepared for the arduous journey. Roads, while generally well-maintained, are few. Holdings that are, as the crow flies, only a short distance apart, may entail a journey of many days along deep valleys carved by rushing rivers, up steep ridges, and around jagged mountain peaks. There is little arable land, aside from a few, relatively fertile river valleys, so most food must be imported into Agasha lands.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Fire Tooth Castle </span></h3><p>AiR p.330</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The ancestral home of the Agasha family, would-be visitors must be led here from the home of the Mirumoto or the Kitsuki, where designated Agasha guides reside for this very purpose. However, a prospective visitor would have to have a good reason for visiting the Agasha family’s abode. Anyone not properly guided can certainly get close to the castle, and see it looming on the peak of a dormant volcano known as Fire Tooth Mountain, but remain unable to find a way in. In fact, the entrance to the castle is a twisting maze of tunnels riddling the mountain beneath it. Fire Tooth Castle is home to the Sacred Library of the Agasha, a repository of natural philosophy and alchemical lore that few outsiders are allowed to visit. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Mountain Song Temple </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Located between Agasha and Mirumoto lands, Mountain Song Temple is described in more detail in the Location Spotlight to the right.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands oF the Kitsuki</span></h2><p>AiR p.330</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The lands of the Kitsuki are generally rugged, mostly comprising the foothills to the Great Northern Mountains. Nonetheless, their lands are crossed by well-maintained roads and trails connecting numerous, albeit generally isolated villages. Some of these settlements are devoted to farming, although the types of crops are dictated by the rocky soil and short growing season; more villages are actually focused on harvesting timber or mining iron, copper and gold. And some, located at higher elevations, are involved in the raising and husbandry of livestock, particularly goats, which provide food and other products to the clan. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Last Step Castle </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The home of the Kitsuki family is a veritable puzzle unto itself, designed to challenge intellect of inhabitants and guests alike.

Those who live in the village have typical livelihoods, such as farmers, artisans, and merchants, but they are also what amounts to actors. The village itself consists of buildings that can be easily taken down and reassembled, allowing the village to be entirely reconfigured in as little as a single day. Crime scenes of nearly any type can be fashioned, with the villagers playing roles in scripted events, giving young Kitsuki investigators an opportunity to hone and polish their skills. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Distant Paddy Village </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Distant Paddy Village is the major trade and commercial interface between the Dragon and the rest of the Empire, particularly for bulk commodities, and particularly for grains and other foodstuffs. Because the Dragon Clan is a net importer of food, it is essential to have a centralized location where all food purchased across the Empire can be delivered, prior to being redistributed among the Dragon families. The Dragon Clan, in turn, draws upon its formidable reserves of gold and iron, as well as stone and timber, to pay for this trade. Distant Paddy Village is dominated by a series of large warehouses and granaries. Throughout the summer and autumn, it is almost always bustling with raucous activity and contingents from all the Great Clans.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Location Spotlight: Mountain Song Temple </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In the fourth century, a monk seeking a wild, remote place for contemplation in the Dragon lands happened upon a plateau near the boundary of the Agasha and Mirumoto lands where the wind made a rising and falling tone as it blew among the surrounding peaks—the so-called Mountain Song. The plateau came to be connected with an obscure quote from the Teachings of Shinsei, a kōan—Enlightenment can be found in the song of stone, if only one can learn to listen. A temple and monastery were later built on the plateau, and many pilgrims come here to listen to the so-called Mountain Song, seeking to discern meaning in its eerie, inconstant notes. While it is officially a holding of the Brotherhood of Shinsei, Mountain Song Temple is unusual, in that it is occupied by monks of many orders, some with very different beliefs and philosophies. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Key Places </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The following are key places of Mountain Song Temple. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Shrine to the Fortune of Stone</strong>.

They believe that increased traffic to the temple of late is interfering with the monks’ ability to study the mystery of the “song of stone,” and have turned their old courtier’s tricks to becoming the foremost successor of Shiho so that they can reform the temple to limit access by outsiders.

It is located a day’s ride from the Imperial City across mostly flat land, so that the Lion Clan Champion may swiftly respond to any invasion of the capital, which is always visible on the horizon.

But after centuries of deforestation within Akodo territory, the Akodo saw little choice but to draw their lumber from the ancient forest. Within, samurai discovered a forgotten shrine dedicated to forty-two Lesser Fortunes, including the Fortune of Agriculture and the Fortune of Stacked Stones. Within weeks of this initial harvest, every one of the directing samurai died suddenly. To this day, foresters avoid the trees closest to the shrine, and wood is drawn from the Heart of Vigilance Forest only in times of dire need. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Authorized City </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Over the past century, the vibrant town known as Authorized City has rapidly grown from a simple farming village at the mouth of the Golden Valley to a fullfledged city.

Oxen and lion prides freely roam the flatlands, while herds of deer wander through the few but dense forests. The lands grow steadily hillier as they reach south and west, eventually culminating in the Spine of the World Mountains, whose foothills house rich copper mines, one of the clan’s most important exports. To the southwest is Beiden Pass, one of precious few crossroads through the mountain range and part of the most important trade route in the Empire. It is named for the legendary warrior monk who is said to have defended it singlehandedly against an army in the early days of the Empire. And there has been reason to defend it many times over the centuries, as a person could throw a stone from the edge of Matsu lands and strike the open gates of Kakita Palace, which taunt the military might of the Lion behind treaties and thin diplomacy. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Last Breath Castle and the Valley of Storms </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Overlooking Beiden Pass from a rising sea of golden grass before the Lake of Sorrows, Last Breath Castle, or Matsu Castle, is the home of the Matsu family daimyō and the military might of the family. It was built at the historic site where Lady Matsu first met the divine sibling Akodo. The nearby town was once the tiny village that Matsu called home but is now the largest and most industrious settlement in Lion lands.

Jointly maintained by the Matsu and Kitsu families, the Hall of Ancestors with its many tombs, shrines, and memorials is the largest funerary complex in the Empire. To be enshrined there is to be recognized as a legend among the Lion; it is one of the clan’s highest honors. Also inside the complex are the histories of the dead, one of the richest collections of genealogical information available to the clan. Traditionally, Lion samurai visit this place at least once in their lifetime to honor the memories of the great heroes who went before them. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Humility’s Lesson </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The largest Lion keep against the mountainous Scorpion border, the castle known as Humility’s Lesson did not always have that name. Originally belonging to the Ikoma, the castle was infiltrated and taken by the Scorpion Clan in the sixth century. The Scorpion intended to use it as a bargaining chip in their campaign to seize Sacred Watch Palace, the seat of the Ikoma family. However, their campaign was disrupted by the Matsu family, whose samurai stormed the keep to retake it. Since then, the Matsu have retained the castle to keep watch over the Scorpion, renaming it Humility’s Lesson in honor of their victory. They hold an annual festival on the anniversary of the castle’s recapture, marked with fireworks and boisterous song said to be audible in Scorpion lands nearby. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands of the Ikoma</span></h2><p>AiR p.334</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In the northeast corner of the Lion lands lie the Venerable Plains of the Ikoma, a dusty region of rolling hills, wild grasses, bamboo groves, and signal towers along minor rivers. There, the lands resemble those of the Lion’s Unicorn neighbors, suitable for the clan’s meager pony herds. Relatively sparse throughout, Ikoma lands are more heavily populated at their borders, especially to the south, where they cast a wary eye on the Scorpion. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sacred Watch Palace </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The ancestral seat of the Ikoma family, Sacred Watch Palace stands just beneath the face of the Mountain of Seven Thunders. The castle was originally built as the primary signal tower of the Lion’s western border. While suitable to host diplomatic meetings and the Emperor’s family, it is still defensible and retains its original military purpose of signaling Western invasions.

These are the most fertile of the Lion’s provinces, boasting their most numerous and prosperous farms and orchards, due in part to the blessings invoked by the Kitsu themselves. Terraced hills, buckwheat fields, trickling streams, and vast plains roll along Kitsu provinces, dotted occasionally by humble shrines, small farming communities, and crumbling tombs from eras long past. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Castle of the Swift </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sword Standing watch over the Lion’s northern border at the foot of the Drowned Merchant River, the Castle of the Swift Sword rises above the plains on a steep, curved foundation of ancient stone. Within this foundation sits the Tomb of the Five, where rumors say the sacred bones of the Kitsu family’s founders rest in a secret ancestral shrine. Before the fourth century, only a temple stood there, but bandits and other threats necessitated an expansion into a military outpost, and eventually an entire keep was built to surround the sacred grounds. Today, the Castle of the Swift Sword is the official estate of the Akodo War College (see the Location Spotlight on page 335), the most prestigious of the Akodo family’s schools, yet it is also the ancestral seat of the Kitsu, where their ritualists train in the family’s secret traditions. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Kitsu Tombs </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While most of the Lion Clan’s heroes are entombed within the Hall of Ancestors above Matsu Castle, the Kitsu family lay their dead to rest within the ancestral tombs of their family. Although they are a Kitsu holding, the tombs and the temple above them rest within Matsu territory. The Kitsu daimyō owns an estate on the grounds, and several ritualists and other samurai live in the temple’s dormitory. The first floor contains the personal library of the Kitsu daimyō, while the second floor is a dōjō training both ritualists and their bodyguards. The third and final floor of the temple is closest to the Heavens—and thus, the honored dead— and is used as a place for meditation and other rites.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Location Spotlight: The Akodo War College at the Castle of the Swift Sword</span></h2><p>AiR p.335</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">At the heart of the Castle of the Swift Sword is a single purpose: war. At any given time, thousands of warriors are stationed in or around the castle for training. Battle cries and the ringing of steel can be heard throughout the day, muffled only by the low rumble of hundreds of stomping feet as soldiers conduct drilling maneuvers outside the walls. Although its student population— and therefore, garrison—is smaller than other military academies, its elite warriors would match the mettle of any force that might dare to attack. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Akodo War College divides its curriculum into three seasonal courses. Students engage in rigorous physical training and weapon mastery through the summer and fall, followed by winter classes in philosophy, tactics, and the Code of Akodo. In the spring, the practical and philosophical are combined in war games. They are expected to set a sterling example for all samurai serving alongside them or under their command. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Key Places </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The following are key places of the Akodo War College. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Training and Parade Grounds</strong>. What was once a simple dōjō founded by Akodo Tokoyama in the second century has grown tremendously, and the Castle of the Swift Sword is now one of the major military strongholds of the Lion Clan. The central castle still looks much the same as it did when its construction was complete, its traditional design undisturbed by war or changing tastes. However, around the central pagoda, the school has added training grounds and barracks for many bushi, as well as storage space for provisions for the ever-expanding army.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>The Ancestral Shrine</strong>.

Adjoining the War College is Ikoma Hall of Scribes. Though smaller than the High Histories at the Ikoma family’s seat of power, it is still a very large library, full of vital information for any military scholar. It contains enormous sections on all topics that could be of aid to future military campaigns.

The Phoenix Clan’s power is not in its economic productivity or strategic location, however, but in the unparalleled spiritual knowledge of its samurai. Amidst the ancient groves, hidden valleys, and high peaks, the Phoenix Clan’s members pursue arcane secrets and religious Enlightenment as one goal, communing with the spirits of their lands in a variety of ways for incredible power.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands of the Isawa</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The provinces of the Isawa are difficult to access; despite being in the middle of the lands of the Phoenix Clan, they are isolated by mountains and forests. The seacoast is rocky, barren, and lashed by unpredictable weather and frequent storms. Inland, the Isawa lands have a large proportion of wilderness. In particular, the Isawa Forest—a large forest with a reputation for being wild and spirit haunted—occupies much of the area, with only a few roads traversing it. Swamp and marsh border the forest on both its eastern and western sides, while farther west, the ground rises into the barren, rugged mountains that border the eastern side of the Dragon Heart Plains.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Isawa Elemental Academies</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Isawa family’s ancestral seat of power, Isawa Palace, is home to the five Isawa Elemental Academies. It is a locus of spiritual practice and research. Although it has little in the way of material defenses, Isawa Palace benefits from powerful and extensive supernatural protection. It is the home of the Great Library, the largest in the Empire, as well as the main council chamber for the Elemental Masters and the contemplative Grove of the Masters.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Isawa Forest</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A strange, spirit-ridden forest, the Isawa Forest is not unlike the far larger Shinomen Forest. The Isawa conduct part of their coming-of-age rites under its eaves; each young Isawa must spend a night alone in the forest in meditation. Because of the Isawa Forest’s reputation for harboring many strange and potentially dangerous spirits, very few trees are harvested from it. When they are, the Isawa conduct rituals to appease the spirits, using the wood to make paper for particularly important scrolls or in the construction of shrines.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">There are many superstitions and stories about the forest and the strange things that may be found within it, including passageways to the Spirit Realms.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">City of Sealed Truths</span></h3><p>AiR p.337</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Although it has existed since before the dawn of the Empire, the City of Sealed Truths is thought by many in Rokugan to be a myth. In fact, it is quite real, but extremely well hidden. Built in the manner of the estate the Isawa abandoned when they left the Dawn Peaks over a millennium ago, the city resembles an ancient township of that land more than it does any city in Rokugan. Additionally, the inhabitants have stayed relatively cloistered from the outside world, and so their clothes, cuisine, and culture have far fewer Rokugani elements than even the inhabitants of other cities in Isawa lands.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The reason for this is simple yet vital: since its foundation before the rise of the Emerald Empire, the City of Sealed Truths has been a place for the storage, curation, and study of all manner of magical artifacts and practices. It is the repository of all the knowledge the Isawa Tribe sought to protect from the Nameless Tyrant, and has kept from others who would misuse it in the centuries since. No small number of the items and lore here are powerful beyond human comprehension, and potentially extremely dangerous in the wrong hands. As a result, the City of Sealed Truths is heavily warded with sigils of power that obfuscate its location and points of entry to those untrained in finding them.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands oF the Shiba</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">AiR p.337</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Unlike the wild, hard-to-access lands of the Isawa, the Shiba provinces are mostly rolling plains sprawling between the Isawa Forest and the Mountains of Regret to the south. Fishing is important, particularly since the coastline of the Shiba lands is somewhat less rugged and better developed than that of the Isawa lands to the north. In fact, Eye of Eternity Castle is the largest Phoenix Clan holding on the coast and is a major port. However, farming is far more prominent than fishing.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Eye of Eternity Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Eye of Eternity Castle, or Shiba Castle, is a confusing, apparently haphazard amalgam of different military, architectural, and engineering styles borrowed from almost all of the clans. Some Rokugani claim it was simply poorly planned and constructed, but others, more canny, discern a cunning, sophisticated, and layered defensive strategy wrought into the seeming chaos, one that would confound and defeat almost any conventional attacker. The Shiba family’s ancestral seat of power, it hosts not only several prominent Phoenix dōjō, but also the Empire’s foremost shrine to Shiba, founder of the clan. As Shiba Castle looks over a major port, most of the clan’s trade with the rest of the Empire passes through it.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Twin Soul Temple</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Located south of the Asako provinces, Twin Soul Temple is the Empire’s foremost academy for the training of ritualists and their bodyguards. The temple contains not only dōjō for the martial training of bushi, but also libraries and shrines for the use of ritualists. The dual aim is to teach bushi, as bodyguards, to protect their charge at all costs, while also teaching ritualists to value the counsel and courage of their bodyguard. This cooperative, even symbiotic, training is a major reason why Phoenix bodyguards are known throughout the Empire as some of the most dedicated and effective.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands oF the Asako</span></h2><p>AiR p.337</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The provinces of the Asako are located mainly in the mountains in the northern and western portions of the Phoenix lands. These lands are rugged and largely infertile, meaning the Asako must depend on imported food and other goods, particularly from the Shiba. While the Asako do not have many holdings, most of the ones they do maintain are located in serene and beautiful places in the mountains. The Asako also maintain several holdings that lie near but technically outside the boundaries of the Phoenix lands, such as the Shrine of the Ki-Rin on the eastern edge of the Dragon Heart Plains.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Morning Glory Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Morning Glory Castle, the ancestral seat of power of the Asako family, is a palace located in the Isawa Forest on the easternmost edge of the Asako lands. More details about it can be found in the Location Spotlight on page 339.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Shrine to Eternity</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The man who would later become the Fortune of Longevity was once a healer who rose to great prominence among the original followers of Asako. So devoted was he to healing that he was elevated to the status of a Fortune, becoming the Fortune of Longevity. The Shrine to Eternity is now the most important shrine to this Fortune in the Empire. Many Rokugani who are ill or injured make pilgrimages here, beseeching the Fortune for miraculous healing. However, such pilgrims must be determined; the shrine is located high in the western mountains, accessible only via an extremely difficult journey along a single, narrow trail.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sheltered Plains City</span></h3><p>AiR p.339</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sheltered Plains City is located on a narrow but relatively flat and open plain between the western mountains and the Isawa Forest. It is the only city entirely controlled by the Asako. Despite the Asako disdain for commerce—they refuse to even name the city’s market—the place bustles with trade, particularly from the Dragon and Crane Clans. The city is also home to a massive library, Kanjiro Library, named after the ninth-century city governor who ordered its construction. It is one of the single largest repositories of knowledge in Phoenix lands. However, since Kanjiro Library is generally accessible to any Rokugani scholars who wish to use it, it also contains very little lore that the Phoenix would consider “sensitive.”</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lands of the Kaito</span></h2><p>AiR p.339</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Kaito currently hold only a small area of mountainous land on the very northern edge of the Phoenix Clan lands, at the northern boundary of the Empire. To the north is mountainous wilderness that is still inhabited by the people whom the Kaito know as their ancestors. There is virtually no arable land here: the Kaito are entirely dependent on imported food and whatever they can hunt or fish for in the surrounding wilderness. Cliffside Shrine is their only significant holding. The Kaito are, however, involved with two other, even smaller holdings.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Water Becomes Clouds</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Water Becomes Clouds is located in a narrow, steep-sided vale through which flows the Ponderous River. For most of its length, this river is deep and slow, but where it emerges from the valley of Water Becomes Clouds, it plunges over a high cliff, becoming a spectacular waterfall hundreds of feet high. The winds off of the ocean are channeled along the gorge forming the river’s lower course, causing the water to disperse as fine spray resembling clouds in the sky, giving the village its name. Despite technically being within the Emerald Empire’s geographic bounds, the village is inhabited by a group of people who never joined the Empire in the days of yore and remain independent even now. The Kaito travel here frequently for trade.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lost Arrow Shrine</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sometime in the eighth century, the Kaito were wracked by a religious schism, and the daimyō at the time declared that he would leave to establish a new shrine for the family. Using the family’s ancestral bow, Mikazuki, the daimyō fired an arrow from Cliffside Shrine, saying they would build a new shrine where it fell. A strong wind caught the arrow and blew it away to the west. It took seven days to find it, lodged in an ancient hemlock tree perched at the top of a cliff. As promised, the daimyō and his followers began building a small shrine around the hemlock and the a new village nearby.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">After only a few months, however, there was no further word from what had become known as Lost Arrow Shrine. A party from Cliffside Shrine found the shrine and village partly built—but no sign of the daimyō or his followers. The shrine still exists, and the Kaito still tend it on a regular but infrequent basis.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Location Spotlight: Morning Glory Castle</span></h2><p>AiR p.339</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Also called Asako Palace, Morning Glory Castle rises from the site of a much older castle, one built thousands of years ago, before Rokugan’s founding. The earliest foundation stones are said to have been set by a local ruler, positioned according to the counsel of traveling scholars from Yún Fēng Guó, and indeed, several stones are marked with the words and motifs of that distant land. Some of the ancient castle structures—raised wooden buildings and a thatch-roofed watchtower rising into the mist—survive to this day, carefully preserved and restored. Surrounding these monuments to history is a beautiful palace of gleaming pale walls and rich red tile roofs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Asako Palace was built on a series of hills in a volcanically active region where hot springs dispense mineral-rich water into natural basins. The palace, which encompasses some of the springs, is devoted to leisure, comfort, and healing. Historical scholarship, always a Phoenix Clan passion, thrives there. Still, among the healers, scholars, entertainers, and servants lurk spies and blackmailers waiting to catch powerful nobles with their guard down. There is trouble in paradise.</span></p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3oKz3lm.png\" /><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Key Places</span></h3><p>AiR p.340</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The following are key places of Morning Glory Castle. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Main Keep</strong>. The castle itself sits atop a craggy hill surrounded by wetlands that could easily be transformed into rice paddies: a classic defensive position for an ancient keep. The early occupants kept a wide ring of wetlands around the castle site intact, however. Legend has it that an ancient king who lived there vowed to leave the wetlands undisturbed after a turtle saved his child from drowning. Of course, it is equally plausible that earlier inhabitants hoped the marshes would impede attackers, as the approach is dangerous and exposed. As a result, the palace has outer curtain walls and a central keep, but most of its structures are built as single-floor mansions. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Library</strong>. Asako Palace boasts one of the most ancient and scrupulously maintained libraries in Rokugan. Built into the central keep to guard against both attack and inclement weather, it has texts that date from the dawn of recorded Rokugani history, including a trove of books written on bamboo strips and uncovered by Phoenix archaeologists. The palace’s collection of philosophical and medical texts is particularly robust. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Shrine to the Fortune of Arts and Letters</strong>. The on-site shrine honors the Fortune of Arts and Letters, whose intellect blesses the flowing waters there. Citizens from all walks of life make pilgrimages to Asako Palace to honor this fortune and carry her blessing back to the waterways serving their homes. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Bathhouses</strong>. Asako Palace is built around natural hot springs: pools of fresh mineral water, naturally heated to various temperatures, that both feel soothing and aid in healing. The palace’s attendants include an order of priests who study restorative methods as an expression of Shinseist devotion. The priests use massage therapy and herbal remedies in their healing. They also guide visitors in discussion, meditation, therapeutic calisthenics, and the practice of arts such as painting and poetry in order to help them process stress.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Venues for Artists</strong>. Asako Palace also features a rotating series of artists in residence, representing every form of entertainment popular among samurai. Nō and Kabuki troupes, puppeteers, champion kemari teams, musicians, and dancers perform and teach master classes daily. Flower arrangers, gardeners, and visual artists from calligraphers to sculptors display their work in the palace’s chambers.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Notable People of Morning Glory Castle </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The PCs might encounter one or more of the following NPCs in Asako Palace.

An elderly monk who oversees the operations at Asako Palace, Raikū is skilled at calmly defusing political and cosmic situations that arise between guests when they come to his attention. However, his true passion is history, and he spends much of his time in the library, allowing matters to sort themselves out. Uses the provincial lord profile with the Phoenix Clan samurai and artist templates. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Asako Hatsumi (she/her)</strong>. A scholar of medicine, Asako Hatsumi accidentally encountered the mazoku Tatsuko while researching an obscure disease in the library. Immediately taken with her, she has been trying to find Tatsuko again ever since, not realizing the object of her affections’ true nature as a mazoku. Uses the seasoned courtier profile with the Phoenix Clan samurai template. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Tatsuko (she/her)</strong>. A servant of the Judgment Overlord, Tatsuko is a mazoku soul hunter who has come to Asako Palace for a break from her hard work seeking souls who cling to the Mortal Realm. She has noticed that Asako Hatsumi has been looking for her, and might reciprocate her interest. However she has misinterpreted the scholar’s efforts to find her as having seen past her cover as a Sparrow Clan storyteller, and is concerned that discovery by a mortal could lead to considerable paperwork on her return to the Realm of Waiting. Uses the wandering duelist profile with the mazoku, investigator, and sage templates. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Yoichi (he/him)</strong>. A specter who has been hiding from mazoku at Asako Palace for some decades, avoiding notice amidst the normal supernatural traffic there. Yoichi is trying to avoid Tatsuko, an off-duty soul hunter who he believes is there to return him to the Realm of Waiting. Uses the ruffian profile with the specter and socialite templates.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Hot Springs and Hauntings</span></h2><p>AiR p.341</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Each of Morning Glory Castle’s dark caves and restorative hot springs are sealed for part of the day or night at the order of the priests who oversee the maintenance of the springs. If guests ask, they are told the springs need to be physically and spiritually cleansed between uses—which they do. But the main reason is Palace Asako’s frequent alignment with various Spirit Reams—and the unusual guests who tend to arrive during these cosmic confluences. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">On misty evenings, ancestor spirits descend from realms above on cloud palanquins. In the dead of night, the administrators of Jigoku and the employees of the Judgement Overlord and his Kings of Hell make the long climb from far beneath the earth to unwind from their stressful jobs judging and processing the dead. Sometimes they find themselves joined by wicked demons and hungry ghosts from the less reputable regions of the underworld. Strange, shapeless creatures from Yume-dō, the Realm of Dreams, mingle with animal spirits from Chikushō-dō and Sakkaku. Setting aside their day-to-day struggles, at Palace Asako, cosmic forces good, evil, and esoteric are often polite enough with one another to soak in the same tub or enjoy a round of shōgi. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The presence of these spirit guests is often whispered about among the servants on Palace Asako’s grounds, but few see them directly. Any bath attendant with several years of service, however, has likely noticed the strange footprints, heard the unearthly sounds, or even been sent by a priest to deliver sake to a “distinguished guest” upon whose face they must not gaze.</span></p><p></p>",

To take the inland route from the northern reaches of Rokugan to its southern lands, one must generally pass through Scorpion lands. This combination of natural barriers and strategic position gives the Scorpion Clan impressive political leverage over the other clans, as almost any territorial conflict or political ambition will occur within striking distance of one or more of its garrisons. While the Scorpion Clan only sometimes intervenes in the conflicts between other clans, the threat it can present to so many different plans has long kept any other Great Clans from successfully pursuing large-scale expansion, which has in turn assured the position of the Imperial line despite its detachment from most military affairs.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Bayushi</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Bayushi family’s holdings sit between the Shinomen Forest and the Spine of the World Mountains, and contain most of the Scorpion Clan’s most fertile land. With nearby large cities like Journey’s End constantly demanding food, this draws a great deal of wealth into the hands of the Bayushi family.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Silk and Shadow Palace</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The seat of the family since the days of Bayushi himself, this massive palace has played host to numerous Winter Courts over the generations and been the site of many historic moments. Surrounded by the forbidding maze called Bayushi’s Labyrinth, even reaching the palace feels like an ordeal, for guests must be escorted through by trained aides, who walk winding, circuitous paths to reach the keep. Inside of this first defense, one sees a set of pristine gardens, and the ominously named Traitor’s Grove, in which each tree is said to be bound with the soul of a member of the Scorpion Clan who turned against their most sacred duty. Finally, one reaches the castle, one of the most opulent in Rokugan, with countless screened chambers decorated in the styles of different eras of Imperial history. Beneath the castle is a shrine around a subterranean lake, into which it is said Bayushi retreated when his time in the Mortal Realm came to an end. Those who seek the clan founder’s wisdom or absolution often pray by this lake, though Bayushi’s alleged answers are cryptic even to those who claim to receive them.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Shrine to the Fortune of Contentment</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The shrine to the Fortune of Contentment rests along Red Lake and is tended by a small group of monks. While the shrine is small, it is almost opulent with artworks venerating this popular fortune, for it was decreed free of any obligation to pay taxes some centuries ago.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Shosuro</span></h2><p>AiR p.342</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Fully enclosed by other Scorpion-held provinces, the Shosuro family’s lands are some of the most urbanized in all of Rokugan. While there are still swaths of pastoral hills and pristine forests, large towns and great cities like Journey’s End are the dominant features of the land.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Castle of Pretending</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">This castle’s position along the River of Gold gives the home of the Shosuro family idyllic views, but the true beauty of the castle lies in its garden. Expansive and filled with carefully tended plants from across the world, it is an alchemist, healer, or poisoner’s dream. Official access to its expansive medical archives is difficult to acquire, but well worth the social maneuvering needed to obtain it.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Journey’s End City</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The city of Journey’s End is infamous as the most corrupt city in the Emerald Empire, often portrayed in popular works of fiction as a den of crime and debauchery. In such works and common parlance, it is known by its other name: The City of Lies. The second most populous city in Rokugan, Journey’s End is in fact a place of societal shift and upward economic mobility for many, which makes it a source of anxiety for some traditionalists. Across its six main districts, people from all levels of the social strata interact, trade, and compete for influence. Criminal organizations do have a great deal of influence, but so too merchant houses, organized labor groups like the Firefighters, Minor Clans like the Tortoise and Mantis, and the Scorpion Clan itself, represented by governor Shosuro Hyobu. Politics here can be as nebulous and complicated as the Imperial Court, and the string of debts, favors, alliances, and betrayals just as dizzying to track.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Soshi</span></h2><p>AiR p.344</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Upriver of Journey’s End on the Gold River lie the lands of the Soshi family, a mountainous domain that is difficult to access, seemingly with scant resources. The founder of the Soshi family selected these provinces to rule with intention, however, as their inaccessibility and undesirability make them the ideal location for the family’s ritualists to pursue their subtle spiritual research.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Castle of Organization</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">So elevated in the Spine of the World Mountains that it seems to touch the very sky, the Soshi family’s enigmatic home is isolated in the extreme heights. Its high towers are often shrouded in clouds, and lit by soft lantern-light day and night, giving it an ethereal quality. Tengu often visit Soshi Castle due to its high elevation and the inclination toward illusion magic that many tengu share with the Soshi family’s subtle ritualists.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">First Breath Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Much more accessible than Soshi Castle, First Breath Castle began as a training center for members of the Soshi family not inclined to illusion magic but has become one of the more substantial academic centers for the study of law in Rokugan. Many magistrates in training from across the clans come here to study a variety of subjects from legal theory to history to geography.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands oF the Yogo</span></h2><p>AiR p.344</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Yogo family’s holdings are the smallest of the Scorpion Clan, but also have a unique strategic role. Nestled along the Spine of the World Mountains, the Yogo family’s lands include Beiden Pass, a key through-point for overland travel when moving north or south in Rokugan. Much of the terrain is hilly and difficult to farm, though as it descends away from the mountains, Yogo territory becomes more useful for traditional Rokugani agriculture.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Castle of Learning</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Surrounded by bleak marshlands, the seat of the Yogo family is a dreary place, its high spires ascending into the gloomy mists that ever cling to the castle. Inside the castle are countless dangerous artifacts sealed away by the Yogo family over the years, the most dreaded of which are several of the Black Scrolls of Fu Leng. Ruled by the dour and dutiful ritualist Yogo Junzo, the castle is a fortress and an archive more than a center of politics. Gaining access is difficult, but the secrets within are often vital to efforts to protect all of Rokugan.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Beiden Pass and Beiden City</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Beiden Pass is a vital strategic position, and so the city named for the pass unsurprisingly has one of the Yogo family’s largest garrisons. The pass is also protected by a secondary fortress at Beiden Overlook, which can quickly deploy troops to intercept armies attempting to move through the mountain pass. Beiden City was established to service the military encampments that reside at the pass, but eventually grew into a place of some cultural renown after the establishment of a large shrine to the Fortune of Literacy. At this shrine, the priests will teach anyone interested in learning to read Rokugani or study the history of the language. Additionally, these priests often journey out to towns and cities in Scorpion lands and beyond. Although literacy among commoners has been on the rise for centuries, literacy rates are especially high in this region, making it the source of a great deal of the popular literature that has swept Rokugan’s cities in the last few generations.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Penitent’s Refuge</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Yogo family is afflicted by a terrible curse: each scion is doomed to betray the one they love the most. Some accept this curse with a resigned affect, others close off their hearts to avoid future pain, and still others try to find clever loopholes to avert it. But for those who have suffered great heartache because of the curse, Penitent’s Refuge exists. High in the mountains, this monastery offers spiritual guidance and martial training to those who have lost everything, giving them new purpose. The penitents are some of the most skilled shinobi in the Emerald Empire, and will hear the pleas of any supplicant who makes the journey to its mountainous domain, from great lord to commoner. However, it is said they only fulfill those requests which stir their hearts to action, without consideration of rank or compensation.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Location Spotlight: Laughing River Village</span></h2><p>AiR p.345</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Laughing River Village is a farming village about a day’s trek from the city of Journey’s End. While it is assumed to be located in Scorpion lands in Adventures in Rokugan, it is archetypical of a small village in most parts of Rokugan, and could be placed almost anywhere with appropriate adjustments to its terrain, crops, and certain cultural expectations. Laughing River Village produces a tea that is well-liked in Journey’s End and other cities across the region, giving it a claim to fame despite its humble size.</span></p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZQ8ngc0.png\" /><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Key Places</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The following are key places of Laughing River Village.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Village Head’s House</strong>. The village head’s house is richly decorated for the home of a commoner, for the success of Laughing River Village’s tea has brought significant riches to the town.

The Forbidden Cave is said to have opened one day from bare mountainside not long after the villagers began to plant tea in the fields to the north. Village children dare one another to approach it, and the adults walk with it fixed in the peripheries of their vision. A text in the Shrine to the Fortune of Literacy describes how it is a portal to the underworld, the cave splitting to terminate in the Realms of Hunger, Waiting, and Slaughter, but the truth of the matter is known only to those who have dared explore it themselves…</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Notable People of Laughing River Village</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The PCs might encounter one or more of the following NPCs in Laughing River Village.

The current village head and proprietor of the local teahouse. Anzu enjoys telling anyone who will listen the history of Laughing River Village’s famous blends and her new culinary experiments served at the teahouse.

In her brother Hantei’s name, Shinjo ruled over the northwestern lands of the fledgling Empire. But when the Ki-Rin Clan did not return after several centuries, the Lion Clan took on the role of stewardship of these lands, claiming that Shinjo’s clan was not returning. When the Unicorn Clan did appear once again, great battles were fought for control of this territory. Even after an intervention by the Imperial Court and centuries of tentative peace, a few within the Lion Clan believe the Unicorn Clan has usurped lands they rightly held for centuries.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Shinjo</span></h2><p>AiR p.347</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Travelers arriving in Shinjo territory might mistake these vast, quiet plains as abandoned. Entire tracts roll by without sign of village or farm, much less the proud keeps dotting the landscape of other Great Clans. But these lands are not empty. The villages are mobile, the people nomadic, and the seasonal orchards and farmlands of wild barley and rye are hidden in plain sight. The Shinjo could never find peace standing still. With wandering hearts they roam their lands, ever-seeking a new adventure.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Far Traveler Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The seat of the Shinjo’s power, Far Traveler Castle is so named due to the difficult journey required to reach it. The castle itself is an unusual triangular fortification, with round towers and white stone, incorporating architectural techniques from beyond Rokugan. Within the utilitarian walls are some of the most magnificent interiors in the Empire, with indoor cascades, vast living quarters, and rich appointments. Among the keep’s most famous chambers, the “Red Hall” contains a collection of hunting trophies and ceremonial weapons, some hung by Unicorn Champions of old. The current champion, Shinjo Altansarnai, proudly hangs monuments to her children’s hunting prowess on these walls.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Water Dragon Lake</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">At the foot of Far Traveler Castle, some legends surrounding Water Dragon Lake are older than the Empire. The oldest claim that the Celestial Water Dragon witnessed one of her kind fall in love with a mortal, giving up her dragon form in order to start a human family. Horrified by the thought that love might ever drive her to such folly, the Water Dragon hid her heart at the bottom of the lake, so that she could never share it with another. Other tales say that anyone who dives deep enough to touch the bottom of this lake will surface in the Bay of the Sun Goddess, all the way on the eastern coast.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands oF the Ide</span></h2><p>AiR p.347</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Entrusted with the southern border, the Ide maintain the most densely populated provinces of any Unicorn family. Filled with rolling hills and farmlands, the Ide provinces are dominated by the Chrysanthemum Petal Lake, one of the largest in Rokugan. The River of the Unexpected Hero bisects their provinces and eventually winds into the Shinomen Forest. Dotted throughout Ide lands, especially away from the lakes and floodplains, are raised hills covered in unmortared stone. Built by the Lion Clan during the time they occupied the Ki-Rin Clan’s former holdings, these burial mounds contain subterranean tombs, which predate the Imperial declaration requiring the cremation of all dead. When the Unicorn reclaimed these lands, the Lion were forced to withdraw, leaving behind the entombed remains and the relics laid beside them.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Great Day Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rising above the northern banks of the Chrysanthemum Petal Lake and the surrounding lakeside town, the palace of the Ide family is the only “traditional” keep in Unicorn lands. Designed for comfort, displaying the clan’s wealth while offering virtually no defense against invading forces, Great Day Castle is nonetheless considered one of the safest places in the Empire.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Golden Yurts of the Ide</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While the Ide are not exactly nomadic, they are no strangers to the road, often hosting diplomatic functions away from their homelands. To this end, they maintain a fleet of mobile palatial tents, known as the “Golden Yurts.” Originally conceived as temporary living quarters during Great Day Castle’s construction, these massive luxury yurts are made from the finest materials and incorporate palatial comforts. In essence, they are a sort of “portable court.”</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Iuchi</span></h2><p>AiR p.349</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Occupying the large stretch of south-eastern territories, the Iuchi provinces are the loneliest of the Unicorn’s. Vast stretches of uninterrupted grasslands are home to herds of wild ponies and deer, and many other forms of wildlife, all thriving in the absence of villages and towns. In contrast to the flats, the western border of Iuchi lands is mountainous and rocky, similar to the steppes of northern Rokugan. These mountains are home to several diamond veins, and mining communities form some of the only villages of the Iuchi. To the east, the Three-Sides-River divides the provinces from the lands of the Lion Clan.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Gatherer of the Winds Castle</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The ancestral home of the Iuchi is one of the best fortified keeps in Unicorn lands, not because of an army presence, but because it is built into the foothills of the nearby Spine of the World Mountains. Its poetic name, “Gatherer of the Winds Castle,” comes from the violent winds that sometimes sweep across the plains below. It is actually one of the oldest palaces in the Empire, built for Lady Shinjo at the dawn of the Empire. It may have even become the ancestral seat of the Shinjo family had the Ki-Rin never departed the Empire. Restored by the Iuchi, the keep is among the most splendid in Rokugan, with a welcoming interior filled with simple comforts and a vast library. A collection of fine artwork, both Rokugani and foreign, decorate its many halls.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Library of Radiant Horizons</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Deep within the complex of the Gatherer of the Winds Castle, the Library of Radiant Horizons is the largest and best-stocked depository of foreign texts. It contains an impressive collection of books and scrolls acquired by the Ki-Rin in their travels. It also displays several maps drawn by those explorers, and a wooden globe constructed from their travels.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Dreamer’s Forest</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">South of the Gatherer of the Winds Castle is a lone patch of woods amid the rolling plains, surrounded by still pairs of back-to-back komainu statues. Those who approach may hear the statues growling, a warning to turn back. This cursed forest is off-limits, filled with some strange malice desperate to escape. Indeed, this forest would have slowly spread to engulf the entire landscape had the Iuchi ritualists not contained it using the Way of Names to bind the entire forest. It is believed that the Realm of Dreams holds this forest in its grasp. Those who venture too deeply into the Dreamer’s Forest are said to ultimately fall into a deep sleep, their bodies gradually hardening into bark, their feet taking root in the cursed soil.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Moto</span></h2><p>AiR p.349</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Moto “lands” is the vast steppe just beyond the western border of Rokugan, stretching to the Pillar of the Sky mountain range. It is a territory they share with other Ujik tribes; for the tribes of the steppes, life continues as it always has, no matter which family “claims” to own the land. Inside the Empire, the Moto claim only a handful of true holdings. The greatest and most well-known is Khanbulak.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Khanbulak</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In 1010 IC, Shinjo Khulan Khan ordered her trusted friend Moto Qaro Khan to build a city on the border between the Sand Road and Rokugan. The city would serve to watch and defend the Unicorn’s unruly and untameable western border and act as the destination of all the overland trade roads coming in from the lands beyond Rokugan. The existing trading post was declared to be part of Khanbulak, the City of the Khan, and a grand and impressive city was planned on the site. The most beautiful and desirable lands in the region were enclosed by great square walls, first simple earthen ramparts and then gradually replaced by shining white stone carted in from the nearby mountains. A mighty castle was erected as well, where the Moto headquartered their vaunted White Guard. Meanwhile, Ujik and Qamari merchants were settling both the city and the designated outskirts. In the century to come, it would swell beyond its walls, play host to a great confrontation between the forces of the Khan and the Qamarist Caliphate, and become the Unicorn Clan’s single largest city. Now, especially with peace between the Caliphate and the forces of the Unicorn Clan, it is one of the most powerful trading centers in all of Rokugan, and perhaps the entire world.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The City Beyond</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While Khanbulak is a large city by any measure, it could never have been contained by its walls, be they ever so expansive. The free-ranging Ujik people would scarcely permit it, and their prodigious herds go wherever they go—they would never fit within the walls. Thus, the outskirts of Khanbulak constantly throng with an ever-shifting assortment of Ujik ordus, herds of hoofstock, and caravans from afar. Here, one can also find a massive horse market, a Qamarist temple, and inns such as Al-Bekwari’s Caravanserai, which serves travelers to Khanbulak looking to trade.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Plains of Wind and Stone</span></h3><p>AiR p.350</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Beyond Khanbulak and its surrounding city lie the Plains of Wind and Stone. This steppe is home to the Ujik peoples, and through it passes the Sand Road, one of the largest and most lucrative trade routes into Rokugan.

It is said that if one goes to this imposing tower in the Plains of Wind and Stone, one can learn the names of countless spirits good and evil, study sorcerous arts unknown in Rokugan, and even learn methods that the ritualists of Rokugan deem heretical…</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lands of the Utaku</span></h3><p>AiR p.350</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Throughout the central and eastern plains of the Unicorn, the Utaku family’s provinces are vast and peaceful, but contain little of note. Farms, villages, and roads are sparse throughout the grassy countryside, leaving plenty of flat land for horses to wander and riders to thunder across the ancestral plains. Only the westernmost lands feature foothills and fertile valleys, with rivers rolling down into the southern lands of the Ide. Battle Maiden Palace A splendid palatial estate, the Utaku’s ancestral keep stands less than a day’s ride from Shinjo Castle. Overlooking the Dragon’s Heart Forest to the west, the keep is otherwise surrounded by flat plains, allowing “visitors” to be spotted from miles away. Because it was built by the remnants Shinjo left behind, it is technically one of the oldest castles in Rokugan, although three quarters of the palace were added after the Utaku’s return.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Yet more impressive than the palace’s blend of foreign and ancient architecture, its bell-shaped domes, or its artificial cascades, is its greatest treasure: the Utaku Ancestral Stables. Often mistaken for a second keep, these stables house the breeding and training grounds of many different steeds. As the estate’s most important feature, the stables enjoy dedicated protective walls and remain under watchful guard at all times.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Shrine of Shimmering Grasses</span></h3><p>AiR p.351</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Easily overlooked on the hilly border of Isei province is a tiny shrine, far from any road or village. While regarded by locals as “Utaku’s Shrine,” it is known abroad by its poetic name: “The Shrine of Shimmering Grasses.” This name comes from the golden grass carpeting the landscape, which appears to sparkle in direct sunlight. Those passing beneath the torii arch into the fenceless shrine grounds often report an overwhelming sense of tranquility and peace. Because of the stillness, travelers sometimes mistake the shrine as abandoned. There are no bells, no songs, and no calls to worship. An ancient horse-chestnut tree grows out of the roof of the ivy-coated shrine. Utaku herself planted the horse-chestnut tree before venturing into the Shadowlands with the Seven Thunders, and so the shrine was carefully built around it. Chestnuts gathered from this tree are used to make a special pastry for festivals.</span></p><blockquote><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Way Stations in Rokugan</em></span></h1><p><em>AiR p.350</em></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>In the Empire’s early history, as roads were built throughout the Emerald Empire, a series of official way stations were established for those travelling the Empire’s roads and rivers on official Imperial business.

Local merchants, laborers, and travelers intermingle with clan samurai, creating a network of local knowledge impossible to tap into elsewhere.

While it is assumed to be located in Unicorn lands in Adventures in Rokugan, it is archetypical of a way station in most parts of Rokugan, and could be placed almost anywhere with appropriate adjustments to its setup and inhabitants. Due to its placement near Khanbulak, Lost Monk Road Station has boomed in size in the past century, going from a tiny station to a massive roadside stop through which considerable wealth flows every year. Built on a river, it is an important watering stop for those leaving the city to bring highly sought-after goods into Rokugan.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A caravan from Khanbulak under the command of Ide Yasu has recently arrived at Lost Monk Station and is resupplying there before traveling further into Unicorn lands with valuable trade goods.

Bolormaa works out of the formal administrator’s office and original lodging house, collecting tolls in the name of the Unicorn Clan. The signboards often contain jobs one might take on. Current work on the signboards includes serving as a baggage helper and guard with Ide Yasu’s caravan, finding a piece of jewelry dropped in the river recently by a passing merchant, and delivering a letter to Laughing River Village for Shinjo Idree.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Samurai Lodgings</strong>. Samurai on Imperial business can use the noble lodgings, as can merchants willing to slide the right coins to Bolormaa, the station administrator. Seated on the riverside, the views of the petals floating across the river are quite stunning.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Shops and Market</strong>.

Bolormaa is the way station administrator, an old woman with a spritely exuberance. She was born to the Menghes ordu, but has settled down within Rokugan’s borders and become extremely influential in the local community, and even local nobles know to keep her in their good graces to receive the best lodgings.

Owner of the Floating Blossom Teahouse on the riverside, and Bolormaa’s daughter. Idree married her wife Shinjo Tamako earlier this year, securing formal samurai status for her family, much to her mother’s pride and annoyance. She is very welcoming of guests, and is currently upselling Laughing River Village tea to teashop patrons with great gusto.

A middle-aged Crane Clan diplomat, fat and embracing a Lion-style chonmage to disguise his receding hairline. He serves as a permanent envoy to Moto Enkhar, the lord of Khanbulak, though he spends most of his actual time in the city running The Evening Flower, a tea shop. He views his assignment to Khanbulak as a dismal diplomatic posting to the furthest ends of the earth. He has come to Lost Monk Road Station to attempt to find out about a missing shipment of tea from Laughing River Village, which he suspects has been misappropriated by Shinjo Idree. However, he is mostly relishing his chance to pick up gossip from travelers from the heartland of Rokugan, as he hopes to someday acquire the political leverage needed to return to the good graces.

A powerful merchant who trades in numerous commodities including silk. She hopes to expand her trade even further by hiring adventurers to scout for new markets along the Sand Road or within Rokugan. Uses the seasoned courtier profile with the Unicorn Clan samurai template, and has four soldiers with the Unicorn Clan samurai template at her disposal, as well as a number of warhorses, camels, and carts of supplies.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Vazhuthi (he/him)</strong>. An ambassador from City of Splendors, Bhavyatapura, Vazhuthi serves in Moto Enkhar’s court in Khanbulak. His friendly demeanor hides a certain brittleness, but he hopes he can use his time in Enkhar’s court to win support and leverage against his political rivals at home. He has come to Lost Monk Station with Daidoji Kiyotaka at the dispensation of Enkhar. Enkhar believes that Kiyotaka is actually a spy who is receiving covert orders at Lost Monk Road Station. He has asked Vazhuthi to surveil Kiyotaka on his trip to Lost Monk Station in turn, a task Vazhuthi finds nerve-wracking and tedious at the same time. Vazhuthi does not believe he will find any evidence of Kiyotaka’s subterfuge, but is excited to see more of Rokugan and prove himself useful to Enkhar at the same time. Uses the @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc]{noble} profile from the SRD with the socialite template.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><strong>Yoshino (he/him)</strong>. The leader of a bandit group posing as a stablehand. Yoshino’s bandits intend to strike the station to create chaos by starting several small fires in the night around the way station, then make off with several horses and high-value items from Ide Yasu’s caravan stolen from the storehouse, escaping to a hideout in the plains a few days ride away. Yoshino and his bandits are more desperate than avaricious, having split off from a larger bandit group operating in Lion Clan lands after a crackdown by the authorities there. Yoshino would prefer nobody to be harmed in the ambitious heist, and is far more willing to threaten violence than actually carry it out, though some among his crew are less scrupulous. Uses the ruffian profile with the trickster template. Yoshino’s bandit conspirators use the ruffian profile, and their number varies based on what is appropriate for the PCs to face.</span></p>",
