If players would like optional reading material to prepare them for the adventure, they may find it helpful to read about Crab lands, beginning on page 316.

Milestone suggestions are included for leveling up PCs where it is narratively appropriate, although GMs may opt for their usual method and instincts for leveling the PCs up. For higher level parties, we recommend GMs scale up the encounters using the CR guidelines in the SRD and their own knowledge of their group’s strengths and weaknesses.

These journeys in search of glory often end at the Kaiu Wall, as the Crab Clan does not permit many outsiders to risk their lives in the deadly Shadowlands if there is nothing to be gained by it. Of those who do venture into this place of dread, many perish.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">There is endless opportunity for heroism in a place of nightmares, but it is also a land of opportunity for the nightmares themselves. Abominations of all kinds wait to claim naive, egotistical souls who dare cross into their dark domain. Whether driven by courage or arrogance, it is unlikely player characters (PCs) will return from the Shadowlands unscathed. However, in the midst of unimaginable peril, adventurers experience clarity in their destiny that strengthens their resolve and their abilities beyond what they ever thought possible. It is here in this unholy forge that only the mightiest prevail and become the subjects of poetry and legend.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">During the course of this adventure, the PCs leave the relative security of the Emerald Empire and pass through the lands and defenses of the Crab Clan to the Shadowlands. This arduous journey takes them to the ruins of Daylight Castle, the once-proud stronghold of the Hiruma family of the Crab Clan. There, the PCs can investigate the disappearance of a prominent heir, face dreadful opponents, and decipher what is truly going on in a haunted castle where everything seems twisted and wrong.</span></p><hr /><blockquote><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Tracking Experience versus Levelling Milestones</em></span></h1><p><em>AiR p.356</em></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>If the GM wishes to use granular, tracked experience as described in the SRD, then they can simply total up the experience points earned by the characters over the course of the adventure and award the listed additional rewards at the end of the adventure (see page 380).Alternately, if the GM would prefer to use a milestone-based approach, they can grant levels at certain milestones listed within the adventure (see pages 365, 376, and 381).</em></span></p></blockquote><hr /><h1>PC Motivations</h1><p>AiR p.359</p><p>Whether a player is creating a new character for this adventure or deciding why their existing PC would participate in the quest, any of the following can be excellent motivations for participating:</p><ul><li><p>To earn a substantial monetary reward</p></li><li><p>To win political clout for their family or clan</p></li><li><p>To prove themself as a hero</p></li><li><p>To satisfy a morbid curiosity about the Shadowlands</p></li><li><p>To show loyalty to their friends who wish to take on this challenge</p></li><li><p>To help Hiruma Yoshino in her time of need</p></li><li><p>To fulfill a political debt to the Hiruma family</p></li></ul><p>The PCs may already be familiar with each other, or it can be assumed they have been organized into a party by Hiruma Yoshino at the GM’s discretion.</p><hr /><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Provisions and Resting in the Shadowlands</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">AiR p.360 </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Resupplying and recuperating is very difficult in the Shadowlands. Most living creatures cannot eat or drink anything procured there. Due to the spiritual miasma that fills the Shadowlands, most creatures also can’t gain the benefits of completing a long rest there, including healing and recovering class resources. A creature can expend one finger of jade to ignore this, but the finger of jade turns to inert grey sludge upon completion of the rest. If a creature would complete a long rest without expending jade this way, it gains the benefits of completing a short rest instead. Nezumi (see page 32) and Lost creatures (see page 388) can eat and drink food from the Shadowlands, and can rest normally within the Shadowlands.</span></p><hr />",

But centuries ago, it was assailed by a demon of great and terrible power: the Amalgamation oni. In the face of such awful power, the castle was lost, and now it is a haunted, cursed place.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The full details of the events are more complicated, though the PCs will not learn this until they reach the castle for themselves. The castle’s lord, Hiruma Tomoharu, raised a desperate defense alongside the heroic priestess Hiruma Masami, sealing the soul of the Amalgamation oni within a mask and locking its body away deep within the vaults of the castle. Masami’s soul became trapped with the demon in the Realm of Dreams, while Tomoharu donned the mask to act as a seal of the demon’s power. However, the minions of the Amalgamation oni sought to free their dread lord, and so the samurai who were in the castle when it fell have stood an endless vigil since. Unknown to their descendants, these warriors of ancient days still carry on the fight even as their bodies wither to bone.Sometimes, members of the Hiruma family patrolling the Shadowlands are drawn to the castle and join the ranks of the forgotten, becoming deathless warriors themselves—Hiruma Shōta is one who has heard the call, for his ancestor Tomoharu’s will is finally failing, and he needs a suitable replacement to don the dreadful mask lest the oni escape.</span></p>",

The first is a checkpoint on the Carpenter Wall. This is the briefest part of the adventure, where the PCs must prepare to cross through the wall to the Shadowlands. From there, the PCs will venture through dangerous and unpredictable terrain for a few days to reach Daylight Castle. Most of the adventure is expected to take place in Daylight Castle, though PCs are welcome to spend more time loitering in the Shadowlands to gain experience—at their own risk.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Carpenter Wall</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Carpenter Wall, also known as the Kaiu Wall, extends from the Sea of the Sun Goddess in the east to the Plains above Evil, near the southern margin of the Shinomen Forest in the west.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">It is by far the Empire’s largest edifice, its vast walls, massive battlements, and soaring watchtowers girding Rokugan’s southern border, the first and final line of defense against the depredations of the Shadowlands.Its story is more than a thousand years in the telling, chapter after grim chapter of courage, duty, and sacrifice.

Once, it was the heart of the clan’s defenses against the Shadowlands. In the eighth century, however, it fell to the Shadowlands, and it remains mired there still.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The History of Daylight Castle</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In the earliest days of the Empire, the first Emperor ordered his brother Hida to defend against incursions from the vile wasteland known as the Shadowlands. Hida and his followers created the “First Wall,” a belt of fortifications—watchtowers, palisades, and bulwarks— designed to block attacks from the forces of their wrathful brother, Fu Leng. Foremost among Hida’s followers was Hiruma, a skilled hunter andscout. Hiruma and his own followers proved so adept at preventing, detecting, and defeating attacks from the Shadowlands that Hida elevated Hiruma’s family in status within the Crab. In the heart of the lands granted to him, he established the Hiruma family’s seat of power, a powerful edifice that became known as Daylight Castle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Daylight Castle became a linchpin in the FirstWall, a center of command and logistics for the Crab defenses. Although small and unadorned by Rokugani standards, it was nonetheless a powerful fortress in its own right. For centuries, it served as the core of the Crab defensive efforts against the encroaching corruption of the Shadowlands.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In the year 314, a powerful army of horrors, facilitated by the treachery of a Kuni ritualist, attacked Daylight Castle. Only the timely intervention of a group of nezumi, convinced to help by the bravery of a young scout named Hiruma Kazumi, saved it from disaster.This impromptu alliance marked the beginning of afriendship between the Crab and the nezumi that has lasted to this day.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Daylight Castle’s long years of glory were not to last.The First Wall, while formidable, lacked the integrated, contiguous defense of the later Carpenter Wall. In 716, the monstrous oni lord now known only as the Mawassembled an army of a size and power not seen since the time of the First War against Fu Leng. Under the Maw’s cunning leadership, this horde revealed the First Wall’s shortcomings. Fortress after fortress fell to the unrelenting offensive. On Last Stand Plain, the bulk of the Hiruma army was lost to the Maw’s forces. At that point, the only major fortification standing between the Maw’s horde and the rest of the Crab lands and the Empire beyond was Daylight Castle, and it was this conflict that finally ended the legacy of Daylight Castle’s remarkable defenses. The castle, along with all of the Hiruma lands, was swallowed by the Shadowlands and now lies outside the Empire, beyond the Carpenter Wall. The Hiruma family remains determined to one day reclaim this ancestral seat of power. Until that day, it remains a bitter defeat for the Crab Clan.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Anatomy of Daylight Castle </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Daylight Castle is a substantial fortress, having been designed as the anchor point for nearly all of the original Imperial defenses against the Shadowlands. Moreover, it was constructed so that it could withstand both concerted attacks and a prolonged siege, so it needed to be able to house, protect, and sustain a large garrison. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Unlike most Rokugani castles, which combine the attributes of a fortification with a variety of nonmilitary components, such as political courts, elaborate gardens, and elegant, stylized architecture, Daylight Castle is strictly a fortress. Designed for the front line of the war against Fu Leng, its construction is stark and utilitarian. Little consideration was given to niceties such as visually pleasing architecture and creature comforts that didn’t directly support its military purpose. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The layout of the castle is straightforward. The outermost feature is the large and imposing curtain wall, now mostly slumped into ruin. This encloses a series of inner subdivisions, which are themselves separated by lesser walls and gates, also now largely in ruins. The innermost wall encloses the four-story keep. Still largely intact, the keep is surrounded by the derelict remains of smaller buildings, including warehouses, smithies, and stables. Finally, the walls incorporate a series of watchtowers of varying size, all in crumbling disrepair.</span></p>",

As the family lord, or daimyō, she must carry on and rule with excellence, no matter what challenges she is met with. She has passed her wisdom on to her only child in the hope that someday soon, he too will become a great leader.

By experiencing the horrors of the Shadowlands firsthand, Crab leaders learn what would happen to all of Rokugan if the Carpenter Wall were to fall to the countless monsters of the dark expanse. Hiruma Asahi, Yoshino’s son and heir, was on his coming-of-age expedition when he vanished in the middle of the night.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">It has been two weeks since Asahi’s disappearance, and as time continues on, hope for his safe return dwindles. Two members of his troop claim he awoke while the sky was still dark and wandered away from camp. At first, his fellow soldiers feared he had been drawn away by the enticing power of the Shadowlands, but when they followed him for a few paces, they heard him mumble about his destiny awaiting him at Daylight Castle. They left him to wander on his own, fearful for their lives should they continue on to the forsaken castle. They believe he left to recover his family’s ancestral wakizashi as a gift for his mother, something he had previously vowed he would do when he was strong enough. The other soldiers in the troop know how important the artifact is to the Hiruma family, but even the most sentimental treasures aren’t worth dying for, so when they were unable to stop Asahi, they returned to camp without him. The Crab already see enough death and they have a saying that a fool’s errand is an errand for one.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Though Yoshino insisted on a search for Asahi, it was called off by the Crab Clan Champion after two search parties were lost to the effort. The Crab Clan is unwilling to risk more of their precious military force on recovering someone who has likely perished.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In an act of utter desperation, Hiruma Yoshino has called for the help of adventurers from various clans as her last hope of recovering her son’s body and the family heirlooms he was wearing, promising the adventurers a handsome reward of gold and political clout should they succeed in this daunting calling. Only one party has answered her call and while all seems lost at this point, she insists on sending them forth in order to rest assured she has done absolutely everything in her power to recover her missing son. The thought of his body being for blasphemous rites by vile sorcerers or creatures of the underworld is too much for her to bear. Of course, a small hope remains that he is still alive, but that hope is a candle close to snuffing out.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Arriving at the Carpenter Wall</span></h1><p>AiR p.359</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">When the PCs arrive at the Carpenter Wall, read or paraphrase the following text aloud:</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A brawny guard beckons you to a provisions tent. His armor, although fashioned from thick, cumbersome plates of steel, boasts harrowing gouges and enough scratches that it might glitter in the sun, if the sun were to ever grace a place like this with adequate light. A few Crab Clan guards raise a brow as you pass, unaccustomed to outsiders in their glum outpost. You hear two of them exchange bets on your survival in dark-humored tones too loud to be considered whispers. If you dare send an admonishing look in their direction, they only stare back, unashamed, as if daring you to relinquish whatever ill-fated quest that will surely bring you to death’s door. The supposed two-day journey to Daylight Castle already feels long indeed…</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Each character is given one finger of jade for protection (see page 200) and a week’s rations of food and water. The group is also provided with a single pony (see the SRD if a profile is needed) to help carry these provisions. Then, each PC is instructed to never trust their senses while in the Shadowlands and not to drink the water or eat food procured there. If the PCs have any questions at this point, they can ask the guard, although he doesn’t seem to know specifics about Asahi’s disappearance and can only relay basic information about the Shadowlands and the threats there, and provide instructions on how to get to the general area Asahi’s troop visited (a two-day march southwest). If a PC makes a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check, they realize they can ask the guard about any possible allies in the Shadowlands such as the nezumi, in which case the guard informs them that the Knotted Tails tribe often ranges in that area, and the PCs might be able to secure help from them. The guard uses the Soldier profile found on page 391 of the NPC Appendix and can have any of the motivations listed there.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Once the PCs are ready to commence, the guard escorts them to the wall; then, read or paraphrase the following text aloud:</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Carpenter Wall looms over you, one hundred feet of dark stone battlements, redoubts, and watchtowers standing between Rokugan and the Shadowlands beyond. You pass by signs of a recent battle as you approach: wounded Crab Clan bushi being tended by healers and ritualists, the dead being carried off to be cremated, and yet more warriors cleaning and repairing armor and weapons. More troops stand guard atop the Wall, as the vigil of the Crab against the darkness never ends. You are ushered through a massive and heavily defended gate that opens to the Shadowlands. The guard bids you farewell, remaining inside the gate, and watches you with a solemn expression until the space between you is closed and all that remains is the horrifying expanse of a cursed wasteland.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A dry, chill wind hisses around you, carrying the mournful cry of a distant…something, a bird perhaps, but no bird you know utters a sound of such malice and misery. Even as you look toward the distant sound, some of the landscape ahead seems to shift and change… or you think it does, because the desolate hills and gnarled trees now seem different under the dark, bloated sky. Worst of all, though, is your pervasive sense of being watched, as though something malign is waiting for you to begin venturing into this hellish place.</span></p></blockquote><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Shadowlands</span></h1><p>AiR p.361</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If there is a single word that can describe the Shadowlands, it is wrongness. The PCs were told not to trust their senses and instincts, and it was good advice. Their surroundings are a disorienting and frightening mix of barren land, trees with contorted branches that sprout shriveled leaves right before their eyes, and pungent, purple fog that blooms from the ground and smells metallic and sour.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Alone in the Shadowlands, the PCs begin traveling in a southwest direction towards Daylight Castle, which they can sometimes see when the ominous fog parts for a moment on the horizon. With a DC 16 Intelligence (History) skill check (with advantage, if the guard informed them of the nezumi), a PC can recognize signs of a nezumi habitat nearby. The DC of this check is 10 for any Crab Clan or nezumi PCs. If the PCs approach the nezumi camp, they find a small foraging party from the Knotted Tails tribe (see Nezumi Backgrounds on page 182 for more information on these nezumi). The foragers, led by a large and boisterous nezumi named Sharp-of-Tooth, tell them their tribe sometimes sees Crab Clan samurai in fancy armor walking alone toward Daylight Castle, a place of certain doom. The nezumi will lead the PCs to the castle if a PC makes a successful DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check, or if the PCs barter useful items such as weapons, cloth, or food for this service. The trip takes two days. If combat breaks out on the trip, the nezumi skitter out of harm’s way and generally try to avoid being pulled into the fight. On arrival, the nezumi refuse to come within a few hundred paces of the castle itself.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Alternatively, the PCs can wander in the general direction of Daylight Castle using a map, although it takes three days instead of two to make the journey due to the shifting landscape. The longer journey exposes the PCs to more risk, but on the bright side, that gives them the opportunity to gain extra experience (if they survive).</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As the PCs travel away from the Wall, the GM should try to communicate this pervasive wrongness of the Shadowlands to them while trying to hint that every step southward makes things even worse. The following sections describe situations and encounters that should drive home the sheer horror of the Shadowlands as the PCs make their way to the last place Asahi was seen.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Corrupted Elements</span></h1><p>AiR p.361</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">More detailed and specific, the following sections can be used to showcase the repellent and otherworldly nature of the Shadowlands by describing the corrupted nature of the Five Elements in the Shadowlands. Consult Table 4–1: Wrath of the Corrupted Elements on page 362. Each result provides a narrative description of the effects the corrupted element can have on characters, a saving throw to avoid the effect when exposed to it, and a mechanical game effect characters who fail the save suffer.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">For every 6 hours of travel in the Shadowlands, the GM should roll once on Table 4–1: Wrath of the Corrupted Elements and have one or more PCs face the resulting threat. The GM can also add these into other scenes and combat encounters as the environment dictates. Keep in mind that the objective is to make the PCs uncomfortable as they navigate the horror of the Shadowlands, not to thwart them completely, so the GM should tailor their frequency based on the group’s status and progress.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">At the GM’s discretion, characters who are familiar with the Shadowlands, such as members of the Crab Clan, Shadowlands nezumi tribes, or inhabitants of the Ghostlands (see <strong>Backgrounds</strong> on page 124) or who have encountered a specific manifestation of a corrupted element before can make a DC 14 Wisdom (Survival) check to spot it beforehand, giving themselves and others a chance to avoid it or at least prepare for the worst.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Remember that characters carrying at least one finger of jade have advantage on these saving throws.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Dangerous Denizens</span></h1><p>AiR p.361</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As the PCs make their way to and from Daylight Castle, they are likely to encounter vile creatures which they must choose to either avoid (if desired and possible) or fight. The encounters below are intended to be used during the course of the journey to Daylight Castle.

If successful, they notice they are being stalked from a distance by a small group of Shadowlands Horrors. The beasts keep their distance from the PCs and remain little more than flighty shadows. If the PCs move towards the beasts, the beasts will move back to maintain the original distance.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">These Shadowlands Horrors do not take any outright hostile action, but if the group notices them, the GM should routinely remind them that they feel a sense of being watched and sometimes see yellow eyes peering at them from the darkness.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Momentary Allies</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">PCs encounter a group of a dozen Crab samurai scouts making their way back to the Carpenter Wall. They are led by a stalwart bushi named Hida Sanji. Their rough appearance and numerous bandaged wounds hint at the many skirmishes they have participated in. After learning the purpose of the PCs' journey into the Shadowlands, Hida Sanji will freely share information and advice about traveling in the Shadowlands. His party is a reconnaissance team tasked with investigating and tracking an unusually high volume of undead movement lately. Over the past week, they have discovered dozens of bands of undead and Lost samurai moving towards Daylight Castle but weren’t able to ascertain why. After losing several of their members in battle, Hida Sanji and his party are returning to the Carpenter Wall to rest and regroup. Their most recent encounter was with a pack of Shadowlands Horrors. They fought them off and killed several. In the confusion, two of their men were separated. Hida Sanji has searched for them, but they are presumed dead.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs mention that they think they are being stalked by such creatures, Hida Sanji and his party will tell them this is fairly normal for journeying in the Shadowlands, a place where things lurk and hunt their prey, sometimes for longer than necessary for the mere thrill of it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs continue to ask Hida Sanji questions about the Shadowlands and threats they might encounter, he will share what he knows.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs divulge that they are heading toward Daylight Castle, one PC can make a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion or Performance) check to try to impart the importance of their quest. On success, Sanji offers the PCs fifty feet of spare rope and one unused finger of jade his group will not need, but is unwilling to commit any of his exhausted soldiers to their venture.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs are being overwhelmed by another encounter and have not yet passed Hida Sanji’s patrol, the GM can introduce Hida Sanji and his patrol as they intervene and assist the PCs.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Undead Marsh</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">On the way to Daylight Castle, the PCs will need to travel through a valley of putrid marshland. The entirety of the marsh is considered difficult terrain due to the thick, sticky sludge PCs must wade through. After an hour or so of traveling through the marsh, the PCs will approach a half-submerged wagon. Barely visible under the rotting canopy, two crates marked with Imperial seals can be seen within the wagon. A PC attempting to examine the wagon can make DC 17 Intelligence (History) check. If successful, they are able to date the construction method of the wagon to a trading group that trafficked jade and other valuable gemstones but was absorbed and disbanded by another group roughly 15 years ago. What the wagon and its team were doing in the Shadowlands is a mystery. PCs may make DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check to sense hostile intent.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A group of undead hide beneath the murky water. While underwater, they are effectively invisible but can be detected by use of an invocation or other magical means. As the PCs get closer, the muck suddenly sloshes and boils, disgorging grotesque, rotting corpses animated by the malign power of the Shadowlands. These enemies use the stats for Undying Warrior found on page 405 of the NPC Appendix. They are each armed with either a rusted blade or rotting bow from that profile, but not both.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The undead begin their assault by grasping at any PCs near the edge of the bog in an attempt to drag them below, attempting to grapple them and drag them into the bog. The bog’s vile slurry is caustic to the living, and a creature suffers 1d4–1 acid damage each time it begins a turn in the bog. Killing an undying warrior frees their victim from the grapple, as do any of the usual ways of ending or escaping a grapple.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">After combat, the PCs can attempt to loot the wagon, though getting to it in the swamp might be risky. The first crate contains two fingers of jade, miraculously unscathed. The other crate contains more mundane items common among travelers and merchants, including a journal that has completely rotted through and is no longer readable. Most of the items are damaged beyond use, but at the bottom of the crate, there is a leather pouch containing 62 gold pieces.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Lost Samurai</span></h2><p>AiR p.364</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As the PCs traverse a barren landscape broken up by a few dying, gnarled trees, they suddenly hear screams of pain and desperation from a distinctly human voice. If they choose to investigate, they can follow the sounds to a heavily wounded Crab Clan samurai who is writhing on the ground in agony. If the PCs approach the samurai, he will attempt to communicate with them in a ragged voice between screams. His name is Hida Kurumi, and the PCs are able to surmise from his uniform that he is one of the members of the scouting party led by Hida Sanji. After he was separated from his party, he was attacked by a Lost samurai who fed him a poison that left him in agony. Call for each PC to make a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check of their choice. On success, a PC feels something is wrong with the situation.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Before the PCs can attempt to aid or question Kurumi further, a small group of Lost samurai reveal themselves from their hiding spots. They were using Kurumi as bait against his will and the PCs have just fallen for their ruse. Each PC who failed their check to detect something wrong above is surprised; each one who succeeded can fight in the surprise round.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">These enemies use the Lost Samurai NPC stats on page 385. The recommended number of enemies for this encounter is 1 + the number of PCs. One of the Lost samurai is the leader of their warband, a husk of a warrior from ancient days called simply “The Ruthless,” and gains the benefits of the Bruiser role template (see page 389). If more than half the enemies are eliminated, or if the leader of the warband is eliminated, the rest flee. The enemies ignore Kurumi during the battle and Kurumi is too weakened to aid the PCs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">After the battle, the PCs can question Kurumi further and attempt to aid him. If questioned, Kurumi tells the PCs that he and another soldier were separated from his party. They were ambushed by a large group of the Lost that numbered about fifty strong. The ones the PCs saved him from were just a small offshoot of the main group that stuck around to torment him.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The leader of the main group is a fearsome woman named Kitsu Ichika, a fugitive from the Lion Clan that now serves darkness. With great horror, Kurumi recounts her sadistic grin as she stabbed his companion with an exquisitely crafted obsidian katana. When life faded from his companion’s eyes, the ground cracked beneath his corpse and hellish hands pulled his soul down to eternal torment. Such cursed relics are mercifully rare, and even fiends know to fear them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">After the combat, a PC can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check to counteract the poison. Certain invocations and other abilities can also negate the poison at the GM’s discretion. If the PCs treat Kurumi, he insists on leaving, and claims to be able to make it back to the Carpenter Wall on his own. If the PCs are unable to help Kurumi, he succumbs to the poison in a few hours.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Waylaid by Shadows</span></h2><p>Air p.365</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">When the PCs choose to rest, they are ambushed by the group of Shadowlands Horrors. If the PCs have previously passed checks to detect the beasts (see Stalked by Horrors on page 363) and have planned for a night guard, they aren’t surprised by the attack. If not, they are surprised. The Shadowlands Horrors stalking them use the Lesser Horror template found on page 408 of the NPC Appendix.

The castle is held by undying defenders—undead warriors who still fight for the Emerald Empire, bound even beyond death by the dreadful necessity of keeping a powerful being of ancient oni bound within the Daylight Castle. The PCs can search the castle for Hiruma Asahi, who the undying defenders believe will succeed their current lord as ruler of the blighted castle. Meanwhile, the Lost warriors of Fu Leng assault the walls of the castle, and in the tunnels beneath, a wicked sorcerer seeks to unleash the oni for her own nefarious ends.

While it no longer serves its purpose, it is still an imposing fortress, built atop a low rise amid a flat plain so that no enemy could approach it undetected, and was designed to offer no cover to a foe who nevertheless drew close. As the PCs study the terrain more closely, however, they should note that erosion and upheavals in the ground that are a common occurrence in the Shadowlands have riddled the plains with craters and ravines. This means that they may make most of this final stage of their journey to Daylight Castle under at least some degree of cover. Even so, the GM should emphasize that from time to time, the PCs must move in full view of the fortress. This is an opportunity to further enhance the sense of menace and potential danger by describing the castle as “looming ever closer, its windows like staring eyes, while distant, mournful wails and cries drift on the fitful, hissing wind,” and so on.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As the PCs approach Daylight Castle, the wind occasionally carries with it the sound of steel ringing on steel, indiscernible shouting, and other sounds of battle. These noises have an ethereal and otherworldly quality to them, and seem to linger in the air. The frequency and intensity of these noises increase with proximity to the castle, and can be heard sporadically from within the castle later in the adventure.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Once the PCs get close enough to Daylight Castle to see it in detail, read or paraphrase the following aloud:</span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As you gaze up at the tallest keep, your eyes adjust against the murky light of the sky and fix on a lone figure wearing the tattered remains of ancient Hiruma armor and a most peculiar and haunting, red-lacquered mask with monstrous features. The foreboding figure of human shape is completely motionless as it stares back at you. It could be nothing more than an inanimate effigy created by a blood sorcerer to scare off meddlesome adventurers, except that you have the unnerving feeling it’s looking through you to your very soul as if it is something shiny and new to add to its collection.</span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check, a PC notices the armor worn by the figure is from the era the when the castle fell, and with a result of 18 or higher on their check, they also note that the armor is ornately decorated in the manner of Crab Clan family lords. It is likely the soul that once inhabited this body was Asahi’s ancestor.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The figure is too far away to perceive any other details. It does not move unless the PCs attempt to attack it, in which case, it moves away from the window and is no longer visible.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Castle Gate</span></h2><p>AiR p.366</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The castle gate is battered and bruised from centuries of war. Huge sections of stone have been dislodged and lay crumbled against the earth at the base of the wall. Blue and purple fluid stains much of the wall around the broken gate, probably blood smeared by some enormous monstrosity trying to breach the small entrance, though the strange coloring gives the impression of bruising. Bleached bones lay scattered everywhere. Some are chalky and soft with age, others freshly picked clean by whatever ghoulish scavengers prowl around the Shadowlands at night.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As the PCs approach the gate, they notice undead samurai silently standing guard inside. The recommended number of guards is 1 + the number of PCs. One has bloated, pale skin and rot seeping from their orifices. Some have leathery skin, pulled taught around their bones, hollows where their eyes have since decayed or been plucked out, and matted hair. The others are in an advanced stage of decay, only exhibiting bones that match the grotesque confetti on the ground. They stand at attention but are not immediately hostile to the PCs.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The decaying guards all wear armor typically worn by Crab Clan soldiers, though the style and construction vary from modern to constructions popular four hundred years ago. With a DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check, a PC notices the discrepancies in the styles of armor. Otherwise, the PCs won’t notice the subtle differences in the armor, as it is quite worn and dirty.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs get closer, the decaying guards will raise their weapons in warning and speak in unison, telling the PCs to leave. “You are not the chosen. Turn back or die.” The guards will always speak in unison in raspy voices, as if they are united by a single ominous will. They respond to most questions and statements from the PC by repeating their demand. The exception is if a PC asks the decaying guards about Hiruma Asahi. They will answer the PCs as follows: “His destiny is here. He must not leave.”</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">This is the extent of what they are willing to share. If the PCs linger too long, move any closer, or attack, the decaying guards will assume malicious intent and the PCs must roll for initiative. The undead samurai guards use the Undying Defender template detailed on page 382. For a more difficult encounter, the GM can replace one of them with an Undying Sergeant. The Castle Gate leads to the courtyard.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Courtyard</span></h2><p>AiR p.368</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As a warning to hostile visitors, the courtyard proudly displays signs of corruption and decay that hint at the wickedness within the castle. The space becomes increasingly sullen under the shadow of the spiked keeps. It’s as if the darkness itself is baring jagged teeth, threatening to swallow the PCs and drag them to the pits of Jigoku. As far as the PCs can tell, there is no one else in the vicinity, although the feeling of being watched has not relented.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The first thing PCs may notice in the courtyard is a large cavity in the ground, a few paces away from the entrance to the main keep of the castle. It emits a strange hissing sound as well as acrid wisps of miasma. If a PC moves within 5 feet of it, that PC must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer 1d4 poison damage, repeating this check once every five seconds they remain. If a PC lingers long enough to make a second Constitution saving throw, call for a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. On a success, that PC sees a tunnel through the noxious mist. If they are feeling particularly brazen, they can jump down and take 1d12 bludgeoning damage from the fall due to the substantial depth of the tunnel. If so, they find themselves in the tunnels under the castle and eventually reach the Secret Chamber on page 378.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If PCs examine the old well, they note that it hasn’t held much water in a long time. The well is about 50 feet deep. There is an old rope attached to the well, but attempting to climb down using it results in it breaking. A DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check allows a PC to catch themselves against ridges in the stone walls and climb back up the well. If the PC fails the check, they fall the entire way down. This is not a freefall due to the close confines of the well, but still inflicts 1d12 bludgeoning damage. Alternatively, the PCs can use their own rope if they’ve brought one or been given one by Hida Sanji and lower themselves safely. The bottom of the well is a tunnel that leads to a forgotten passage that is carved into the mountain and exits into a trapdoor on the second story of the right tower.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Opposite the well, there is a passage carved in stone but unfortunately, it has been blocked by rubble. Clearing the rubble in a timely manner is out of the question, but with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check, a PC can peek through small holes in the rocks to see the Hidden Courtyard behind (see page 369). The main point of interest they can detect from their vantage point is a pool of red water that seems to swirl with white symbols. It is too distant to see the symbols clearly. The pool is surrounded by stones and casts a harsh red light over the entire room. Past it, several undead guards stand at attention.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Upon further searching the courtyard, the PCs will make a disturbing discovery. An undifferentiated mass of heaving, pulsating flesh has taken up residence there. If they approach it, the PCs find that the mass has the ability to communicate, conversing through direct contact with their minds: a profoundly unpleasant experience, like slimy worms slithering under one’s scalp. The growth is in extreme agony and emanates anger and frustration. There is a distinct intelligence to it as well, and as soon as it detects the PC’s presence, it will begin to incoherently babble about being trapped and helpless. The telepathic link is too obscured by the growth’s pain to clearly decipher much besides a pitiful pleading to go to the tower to the right to help it. If PCs try to hurt the growth, it recoils and implores them to stop. If severed, both parts remain living and will slowly grow even larger. Any attempt to destroy the growth by other means results in a similar outcome. A DC 8 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check reveals that the growth is somehow immortal and, most disturbingly, might be made of what was once human flesh.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The last area of interest in the courtyard is the doors leading to the main keep’s court chamber.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Hidden Courtyard</span></h2><p>AiR p.369</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The hidden courtyard is guarded by three Undying Defenders and an Undying Ritualist (use the Experienced Ritualist profile from page 395 of the <strong>NPC Appendix</strong> with the Defender of Daylight Castle template from page 382). If PCs enter the hidden courtyard, the undead samurai will attack them on sight while chanting at them to leave or die. The middle of the courtyard contains a powerful magic seal which the PCs can investigate, as detailed in <strong>The Seals of Daylight Castle</strong> below. The hidden courtyard has a staircase leading to the trapdoor in the court chamber, a passage leading to the tunnels, and a hidden entrance to the secret chamber that can be discovered with a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) or Wisdom (Perception) check.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Entering Daylight Castle</span></h1><p>AiR p.370</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Once the PCs haul open the doors to the castle itself, read or paraphrase the following aloud: </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Inky darkness fills the space before you. A few small windows are positioned high in the large space, but the sullen clouds outside have allowed little light to pass through. A gentle breeze greets you from within the entrance hall, though it’s hard to imagine why a breeze would be moving in the opposite direction of the doors inside the enclosed space. The air is the freshest you’ve experienced since entering the Shadowlands, but as the breeze dissipates, so does the soothing quality of the air. The stink of rotting flesh, putrid plant life, and stale air assaults you. Though you can’t see anyone or anything immediately in front of you, the ground beneath your feet seems to echo a deep, unnatural undulation. You feel a deep, brooding sense of silent anticipation settle in your stomach. </span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The entry hall is decorated with human skulls and skeletal arms sprouting from the walls and support beams, giving the impression that the bones themselves are attempting to escape this wretched place, even long after death. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Search for Asahi </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Asahi is currently being held in the Samurai Quarters (see page 375).

The dreams always begin the same. A middle-aged woman dressed in a light blue and crimson ritualist kimono begs for their assistance. She is terrified of a shadow that menacingly stalks her from the edges of this dream. Her hands shake as she lifts a mirror. In the mirror, her reflection’s mouth is sewn shut and is bleeding from the punctures in her skin and lips. The reflection desperately tries to communicate, but it is of no use. The woman tells you the reflection is her future if the shadow, an ancient and powerful oni, is not destroyed once and for all. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs ask how they can help, the woman reveals herself as the spirit of Hiruma Masami, a ritualist who performed an invocation to trap a powerful oni and herself in Yume-dō, the Realm of Dreams using a technique learned during her studies with the Moth Clan. Because she is trapped in Yume-dō, she can only communicate with the PCs through their dreams. She implores them to find the undead daimyō wearing the oni’s cursed mask and destroy the mask. She claims the mask of the oni houses its evil soul, and destroying the mask will effectively send the oni back to Jigoku where it can never haunt her or hurt anyone again. She tells them that by destroying the mask, they would also set her free and allow her soul to be peacefully reincarnated. This dream will repeat each time the PCs take a long rest, although they will be able to ask Masami different questions each time. If answering any of the PCs’ questions would reveal too much, the shadows at the edge of the dream intensify, and Masami seems to temporarily lose her ability to speak. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Each PC visited by Masami gains the benefit of a long rest without needing to expend a finger of jade, as if something pushed the malign intent of the Shadowlands elsewhere for the duration of the dream.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Court Chamber</span></h2><p>AiR p.371</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Located on the main floor of the keep, the court chamber is small by Rokugani standards. It is an open area sporadically decorated with unraveling tapestries, broken furniture, and other relics of the castle’s better days. PCs hear the thrum of a forge and the ringing of a hammer on an anvil nearby. The Court Chamber opens into the rest of the main floor. A massive chasm separates the main floor of the castle into two sections. It appears to be about 100 feet deep, with running water lazily flowing below and emptying into an underground stream further down. A makeshift wooden bridge positioned in the middle of the room allows the PCs to pass from one side to the other safely. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The main points of interest on the main floor are a statue of Hiruma Tomoharu, the former lord of the castle, a trapdoor leading to the hidden courtyard, the armory, the skeletal remains of a massive beast that now serve as a staircase to the right tower, and the temple. There is also a giant hole in the ceiling with a makeshift ladder that leads to the second story of the main keep. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The statue of Hiruma Tomoharu is in remarkably good condition and appears to have been polished recently. Tomoharu had an imposing figure and was rumored to be a peerless swordsman, gifted tactician, and dedicated leader. A rope appears to be firmly connected to the base of the statue. It leads into the chasm below and onto solid ground near the underground river. Belaying down this rope leads PCs into the tunnels. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Observant PCs can make a DC 16 Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Nature) check to discover numerous tracks leading to and from an abandoned storeroom filled with rubble. PCs can use this information to discover a trapdoor faintly hidden beneath some lumber that leads down a stone staircase to the hidden courtyard. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Servants’ Quarters</span></h2><p>AiR p.371</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The PCs can enter the servant’s quarters from the old well in the courtyard or the staircase of bones in the court chamber. The room is dominated by the same kind of fleshy pulsing growth as in the courtyard, but this one spans the majority of this space. The bone staircase exits to an area guarded by a number of Undying Defenders equal to the number of PCs in the party – 2. Upon spotting the PCs, the Undying Defenders instantly launch an attack unless they have been subdued by other commands. While in the servant’s quarters, the PCs notice that the constant sound of battle present in other locations in the castle is absent and replaced by a rhythmic pumping sound from the fleshy growth. This makes the location suitable for taking a long rest, though they must expend jade as normal to gain its benefits. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If PCs rest here, they are visited in their dreams by the oni pretending to be Masami. The real Masami is unable to sense or overhear any conversation that happens in this room, and the Masami PCs meet in their dream here will not be holding the hand mirror with her disfigured reflection as usual. The dream is similar to the standard dream, although if asked about the missing hand mirror, the Masami imposter will tell the PCs that particular fate is becoming less likely for her because the PCs are closer to destroying the mask and helping her finally be free. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Despite the immense pain, the fleshy growth is better able to communicate in this room due to its size. If the PCs choose to interact with it here, it falsely introduces itself as Hiruma Tomoharu, the ancient daimyō of the Hiruma family and commander of Daylight Castle. It claims the oni has cursed it to live an eternity of pain and suffering trapped in this grotesque form.</span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Ancient Blade</span></h3><p>AiR p.372</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Upon closer inspection, the PCs will find a beautiful and ornate sword thrust into the creature, plunged all the way to the hilt. Removing this blade frees the growth of its pain and allows it to think and communicate clearly. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The blade is the ancestral wakizashi of the Hiruma family (see page 130). If he is with the party, Asahi will identify the item on sight and declare the wakizashi rightfully belongs to him and his family. If he is not present, a PC can identify the item and its properties with a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The blade is a +2 awakened wakizashi (see page 213) with the jade strike invocation (see page 276) sealed within it. It has the quirk of whispering warnings of danger that only its wielder can hear when the minions of Fu Leng draw near. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Talking to the Fleshy Mass</span></h3><p>AiR p.372</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs attempt to communicate with the fleshy growth claiming to be Hiruma Tomoharu, it will explain that the oni was weakened by a ritualist named Hiruma Masami who sealed its soul into its mask during their conflict four hundred years ago. Since then, the oni has slowly been recovering its power. The fleshy growth claims the mask is able to possess whoever wears it, and in order to fully awaken its power, it needs to possess Asahi, who is a descendant of Masami, and whose blood can help free it. If questioned about Asahi, it will claim he is being confined in the Samurai Quarters in the main keep until the oni is ready to ritually sacrifice him to regain the rest of its power. The fleshy growth claiming to be Hiruma Tomoharu has been able to contact Asahi and wishes for the PCs to free him and prevent the oni from passing the mask to him. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If PCs further interrogate the mass, it will explain that the soldiers guarding the castle have been possessed by the power of the mask and are under the oni’s power. To break the curse and banish the oni, the PCs need to destroy two seals that stabilize the oni’s power, then break the mask. The seals are located in the hidden courtyard and the student’s quarters. The fleshy growth goes on to explain the passages and paths of the castle necessary to reach these locations. It also cautions that the oni has the power to mind-control and persuade, so it advises the PCs to strike the masked daimyō down before it can talk to them and start to gain control over them. With great earnestness, the fleshy mass tells the PCs to avoid traveling to the temple, as it has been corrupted, and those who enter become confused and unable to tell reality from the oni’s illusions.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">This fleshy creature is not, in fact, Hiruma Tomoharu, but fragments of the oni’s nearly immortal body, bereft of its sealed-away soul. It seeks to reunite its soul with its body, thus becoming complete and mighty once more. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While the entity appears helpful, a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check gives a PC an uneasy, suspicious feeling that the fleshy mass is hiding something from them. Anything lower leaves the PC feeling confident that the fleshy mass has their best interests and the best interests of Rokugan at heart. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If accused of dishonesty, the creature vehemently denies that it has lied or told half-truths at any point. It speaks to the PCs in a pleading and eager tone, always claiming to be a victim of cunning evil. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs raise their doubts a second time, it will lose its temper and lash out by insulting the party for being dull before quickly apologizing and asking for forgiveness. It claims the constant torture it has endured has made it irritable and weak. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs have gained knowledge of its true identity (a portion of the soulless body of the oni), it attempts to persuade them to aid it in its return to power and offer them rich rewards and forbidden power. If they agree and take actions to weaken the defense of the castle and free the oni, the PCs gain the Shadowlands Might feat found on page 224, and the oni and most other evil creatures in the Shadowlands won’t take hostile action against the PCs unless provoked. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs try to attack the fleshy mass, it is a futile effort. It has no vital organs. If they sever part of it, the two parts grow back seemingly stronger. The structure around the mass is crumbling and unsound, and the bulk of flesh acts to support the walls. Removing it is likely to cause the room to collapse. Even if provoked, the fleshy mass does not retaliate.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Armory</span></h2><p>AiR p.372</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The armory is home to the massive skeleton of a reptilian beast. How old the bones are is a mystery, but they are now infested with tiny, glowing insects that have started to gnaw away at the rough surfaces. Upon entering, PCs will find they are not alone. Several Undying Defenders are sharpening and repairing weapons, a task that seems a little too advanced for typical undead. They are supervised by an unarmored samurai with a katana and wakizashi in his waistband, who is hammering on a blade. While also undead, his expressions and mannerisms seem thoughtful and intelligent. In the corner of the room, a heap of broken armor and weapons that have been snapped or chipped lay waiting to be repaired. The rest of the room is lined with weapon racks and stands where armor is stored. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The inhabitants of the room, besides the supervisor, have the same trance-like mannerisms as the other Undying Defenders in Daylight Castle. Upon noticing the PCs, they will turn in eerie unison and begin chanting. “You are not one of the chosen. Turn back or die.” If their request is not immediately heeded, they become hostile and attack the PCs. The recommended number of enemies for this encounter is the number of player characters +1. Most of the enemies are Undying Defenders, but the supervisor is a blademaster who uses the Wandering Duelist NPC profile from page 392 with the Defender of Daylight Castle template from page 382. To increase the difficulty of this encounter, the GM can substitute an Undying Defender with an Undying Sergeant. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">After the battle, the PCs can loot the armory. The various weapons and armor on the racks are remarkably well maintained and in good condition despite evidence of numerous repairs. The weapons have a strange green sheen to the metal. A DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) reveals these weapons have been infused with jade and are considered magical for the purposes of overcoming the resistances and immunities of Lost creatures. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The armory is vast and well-stocked. It contains most martial and simple weapons, as well as most types of common shields and armor. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History) check reveals the weapons and armor are all from different time periods ranging from modern to over 400 years old (for a member of the Crab Clan, the DC is 9). The GM can choose which weapons have been infused with jade (see page 200). </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Temple (</span><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Candle Temple)</span></h2><p>AiR p.373</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Candle Temple is protected by a powerful invocation that has sealed the doors shut. Upon reaching it, the PCs can see that an offering must be made to break the seal and allow access. The space for the offering is a wooden dish. If the PCs have encountered Masami’s hand mirror in physical form or in a vision, they can make a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine that the bowl is roughly the right size to hold it. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Barracks </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Mounds of dirt punctuate the floor of the barracks while aggressive root structures snake around the room and climb through the ceiling. The room smells earthy and damp. Thin, reflective silk threads line the room, and human-sized silk cocoons hang from the taller root structures. Three Undying Defenders stand rigidly at attention by the entrance. They will attack the PCs on sight. If a PC gets within 15 feet of one of the mounds of dirt, a Giant Spider (see SRD for stats) springs forth and attacks. Giant Spiders will ignore the Undying Defenders, preferring live prey. The recommended number of Giant Spiders is a number equal to half the number of PCs, rounded up. After a round of combat, the PCs hear a commotion upstairs. Two rounds later, two additional Undying Defenders enter the encounter from the root that forms a ramp between the floors. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs investigate the cocoons, they find the hollow husks of Lost Samurai and a total of 17 gold pieces from the pouches of the victims. The mammoth rootlike tendrils growing throughout the room can be used as a makeshift staircase to access the samurai quarters above since the actual staircase has long been destroyed. The balcony of the barracks features a rickety bridge made of wood and stone that connects the room to the left keep of the castle and leads to the dōjō. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Dōjō</span></h2><p>AiR p.373</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The dōjō is filled with Undying Defenders (see page 382), most of whom have suffered such egregious wounds that their bodies are effectively nonfunctional. They are laid out respectfully, and those that still have eyes wait with distant stares. Several Undying Defenders in slightly better shape stand guard, particularly around the entrance to the tunnels, while Undying Purifiers slowly and methodically attend to the wounded by sewing gashes back up and painstakingly reattaching rotting limbs and bones with ritualistic magic. How they are still able to access the favor of the gods will likely be a mystery to the PCs until they learn the true mission of the Undying Defenders. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Upon entering the dōjō, the occupants will launch an immediate attack on the PCs. The number of Undying Defenders still able to fight is equal to the number of PCs +2. Before combat starts, deal 3d10 damage to each of the wounded Undying Defenders to represent the damage they have sustained from previous battles. Additionally, two Undying Purifiers aid them in battle.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The dōjō has a staircase leading to the student’s quarters, a bridge leading to the barracks, and a passageway leading to the tunnels. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Student Quarters</span></h2><p>AiR p.374</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The student quarters contain two Undying Defenders and two Undying Sergeants.

Instead, the smell of old paper and toppled wooden furniture make for a cozy, if dilapidated, ambiance. Ancient scrolls lay scattered across the floor and piled in heaps in the corners of the room. Many of the scrolls have been poorly preserved and damaged beyond use, but some still offer mundane information about past battles with various Shadowlands threats, many of which have been replaced by new, more menacing ones. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In the center of the library, there is a pedestal with a large scroll spread across it. Time has faded the ink and obscured the terminology and subject matter. If a PC succeeds a DC 17 Intelligence (Religion) check to decipher the text, they learn the scroll details several ancient rituals and glyphs for protection against evil. One even explains the complex process of sealing demonic souls into magical items. These rituals require a great sacrifice and many rare components the PCs aren’t familiar with, making the rituals impossible for them to replicate. If the PCs would like to continue searching the room, a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a hidden stash of scrolls well preserved in wax. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">There are six scrolls in the hidden stash. They describe the final weeks of Daylight Castle during its siege by an unnamed oni. A powerful ritualist named Hiruma Masami was planning to attempt a ritual to bind the oni to its mask, but the price would be that of her own freedom as well. She believed the mask would need to be guarded from allies of the oni, meaning the last remaining noble Hiruma guardians of the castle would need to guard it indefinitely and recruit their descendants to take up arms for them when their decomposing bodies eventually broke down beyond the point of continued animation. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Without a check needed, one of the PCs will feel a gentle breeze drift in the direction of a table. In the center of the table, there is a small, lacquered hand mirror reminiscent of the one Masami holds in the PCs’ dreams. If the PCs have visited the temple, they can make a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check to note that it looks like it would fit perfectly in the offering bowl outside the temple.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Temple Revisited</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">AiR p.375 </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">By depositing Masami’s lacquered hand mirror onto the offering dish outside the temple, the doors open, and the PCs can enter. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Candle Temple is cloaked in a thick blanket of dust. It appears as if it has not been entered for hundreds of years. It does not appear defiled in any way. In fact, there is a faint, supernatural hum that gives the room a feeling of warmth and safety.

They will also become aware that the group can take one long rest here without needing to expend jade to gain the full benefits. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">More Dream Visitations </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs choose to rest here, they will be visited by Masami in their sleep. Here, she finally looks at peace, but there’s also something peculiar about her. A dozen puncture wounds dot the skin around her mouth and her lips, but no thread holds her bound. Instead, she may finally speak freely. She reveals that the reflection the PCs encountered in earlier dreams was the real Masami, but the version of herself that could previously talk was not. Instead, it was an imposter, the oni itself, trying to trick the PCs into doing its wicked bidding to facilitate its escape from the noble Undying Defenders that keep it prisoner. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The oni can enter the dreams of those Masami tries to communicate with outside of the temple’s safe haven, but she has found that this link goes both ways and has been able to observe the oni communicating with followers of Fu Leng through dreams. Through this link, she has learned of Kitsu Ichika, who possesses a cursed blade she calls “Obsidian Grin” that is capable of sending those it slays directly to Jigoku. She asks the PCs to recover it and use the blade’s power against the mask of the oni. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">They will need to retrieve the mask from the current daimyō and bring it to the body of the oni contained in a secret underground tomb before stabbing it with the cursed katana. Doing so will banish all of the oni to Jigoku instead of freeing it like any other weapon used against the mask would. Since Masami’s soul is bound to the oni’s through the ritual she cast to ensnare it, she would fall into the realm of torment for unfathomable eons. However, she is willing to endure such a fate to end the threat of the oni once and for all. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The PCs can ask Masami anything they would like, and she will do her best to answer them, especially regarding the history of the Hiruma vigil against the mask of the oni. It is clear she esteems the Undying Defenders highly and appreciates their continued sacrifice. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs have not yet found Asahi, Masami tells them he is being kept in the samurai quarters. If Asahi is with the party already, Masami encourages him to either take up the duty of wearing the mask or to take a risk and help the PCs get the cursed katana and slay the oni once and for all. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Samurai Quarters</span></h2><p>AiR p.375</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The guards in the samurai quarters previously mobilized to fight in the barracks, leaving this area unguarded. A room has been boarded up from the outside. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs listen carefully, they can hear someone whispering on the other side, but no matter how long they listen, only one voice is audible. With a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, they discern that it belongs to a human adolescent who is talking about destroying the oni. If the PCs break down or otherwise circumvent the door, read or paraphrase the following aloud: </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A human wearing stately armor is hunched over in the corner of the simple room. His long black hair is matted to his face, and he looks a bit pale, although alive and relatively unharmed. Upon seeing you are not Undying Defenders, he identifies himself as Hiruma Asahi. </span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Asahi has become convinced by a fleshy tendril that the only way to destroy the oni is to kill the daimyō and break the mask. He wishes to join the PCs in doing so. He has also had dreams of Masami, though he does not understand he is being fooled by them. If the PCs ask him why he came to Daylight Castle, he will tell them he was possessed by a dream of one of his ancestors.</span></p><blockquote><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Milestone two: Finding Asahi</em></span></h1><p><em>AiR p.376</em></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>If using the milestone method for levelling up, instead of gaining experience for each encounter, each PC of fourth level or lower gains 1 level upon completing their first long rest after finding Hiruma Asahi.</em></span></p></blockquote><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Daimyō’s Chambers</span></h2><p>AiR p.376</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Whether traveling with Asahi or not, when the PCs enter the daimyō’s chambers, read or paraphrase the following aloud: </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As you ascend to the highest level of the keep, you feel a sense of majesty and suffering in equal measure. The daimyō’s chambers retain an air of nobility, although the walls are crumbling, and all of the beautiful relics of wealth and status lay broken and warped on the floor. Tapestries of intricate artistry have ripped and faded with time, carved furniture has been reduced to splintered wood, and gold artifacts hide in piles of rubble as if they hold no value at all. As your eyes lift, you see an elegantly fashioned throne and an impossibly still figure sitting, staring back at you. It wears stately armor and a gleaming red mask inlaid with horns and jewels. Behind the mask are hollows where eyes may have once been. The figure is nothing more than a shriveled old man with the grace of a legendary lord. Miraculously, it appears he is still mortal. </span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">When the PCs speak with the daimyō, Hiruma Tomoharu (see page 383 for his profile), he is suspicious and accusatory. If Asahi is already with the group, he will command him to take the mask and fulfill his destiny as the next daimyō of Daylight Castle. If Asahi refuses, Hiruma Tomoharu grows frustrated and angry. He may even begin to lecture Asahi on the importance of a leader fulfilling their duty to their people. If the oni were to escape, it would likely launch an attack on the Carpenter Wall. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Although it would probably be stopped by the Crab Clan’s forces, much of the wall would be destroyed by the time it was neutralized, which would have dire consequences if other Shadowlands threats were allowed to flood in. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs have a good understanding of the situation due to interactions with Masami, reading from the hidden stash of scrolls in the library, or realizing the oni’s duplicity through conversations with its bodily tendrils, they can persuade Asahi to accept the mask with a DC 18 Charisma (Persuasion) check. He has spent his entire life training to be the next Hiruma family daimyō, but this isn’t exactly what he had in mind. Asahi is reluctant to leave everything he knows behind, including the prestige and comfort of his station. Daylight Castle is in ruins, and he cannot see himself remaining there forever, leading a decomposing host. It takes an especially persuasive PC to convince him he must make this great a sacrifice. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Due to his clouded mind, Hiruma Tomoharu has difficulty understanding the adventurers’ and Asahi’s points of view. If the PCs do not yet know the full story of the castle and the oni, he will see the adventurers’ ignorance as incompetence and be less likely to reason with them. If the PCs accuse him of being the oni or being possessed by the oni, he will tell the PCs their minds have been poisoned by the real oni. If the PCs don’t backtrack at this point, Hiruma Tomoharu will decide they are beyond saving and will attack. He will not attack Asahi though, as he believes him to be of dire importance to the cause. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs still haven’t figured out what is going on or if they don’t have Asahi with them yet, this might be a good time for the GM to de-escalate the situation and create an opportunity for the PCs to leave peacefully and return when they are ready. Hiruma Tomoharu can simply tell them they are not ready and to return when they have figured out what is truly going on. He would likely also issue a warning against the craftiness of the oni and ask the PCs not to harm the Undying Defenders. If they agree, the Defenders of Daylight Castle will not be hostile toward them from this point on unless provoked. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If they are ready, the PCs can convince Hiruma Tomoharu they are here to help and are on his side with a DC 14 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the PCs have had a conversation with the real Masami in the temple and share details of this encounter with Hiruma Tomoharu, they can persuade him without a check. If persuaded, Hiruma Tomoharu will not act hostile to the PCs and will take time to fully explain any gaps in information the PCs might have about the situation at Daylight Castle. Furthermore, the other inhabitants of the castle under his command will no longer act hostile to the PCs for the rest of the adventure or until the PCs provoke them or side with the oni and the followers of Fu Leng. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While Masami’s plan involves her sacrificing herself along with the oni, Hiruma Tomoharu can’t bear the thought of one of his most loyal subjects suffering for eternity in Jigoku. He proposes the PCs break the mask with a regular weapon in the secret chamber, which would free the oni and Masami. Then, they would need to slay the oni with the cursed katana of Kitsu Ichika. This would be much riskier than simply binding the oni’s unbroken mask to its body and slaying it with the cursed katana before any souls can escape. If the PCs have already recovered the cursed katana, he will escort them to the secret chamber and have his forces gathered round to defend against the followers of Fu Leng. The evil forces have pursued their assault with increased urgency at the behest of the oni, and Hiruma Tomoharu knows the time for heroic action grows near. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Whenever Hiruma Tomoharu eventually removes the mask, it causes him to age rapidly, leading to his death within seconds. He will not remove it unless Asahi claims he will take over his post or the PCs convince him to let them use the cursed katana on the oni. If they go with his plan to save Masami, this will lead the PCs to the final confrontation in the secret chamber. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Alternatively, PCs can choose to kill Hiruma Tomoharu and take the mask of the oni. Without anyone wearing the mask to help form a link to the Realm of Dreams, the Undying Defenders will remain motionless, unable to do anything without prompting, thus effectively disabling the defenses of the castle and allowing the followers of Fu Leng to storm the castle. Upon realizing this, the PCs can attempt to persuade Asahi to don the mask and take the fallen daimyō’s place with a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check if he is with the party. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Destroying the mask releases the oni’s soul, which quickly travels to the secret chamber, uniting with its body and causing its rebirth. This is one way the PCs might usher in the final confrontation (see page 378). </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A PC that attempts to wear the mask themselves will feel a torrent of spiteful emotions and bloodlust and must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw every hour they wear it. If they fail, they take 1d10 psychic damage. On a success, they can marshal and coordinate the remaining defenses of the castle, although they must repeat the Wisdom saving throw every hour and the Defenders of Daylight Castle can only move and act at their normal speed, making sustained action taxing and difficult. Attempting to get the Defenders of Daylight Castle to act in the interest of the oni or to leave the castle results in them remaining motionless until their orders have changed to ones that support the defense of the castle against the followers of Fu Leng and other threats. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs have willfully allied with the oni by the time they reach the daimyō’s chambers, Kitsu Ichika (see page 385) and several Lost Samurai (see page 385) arrive on site. If the PCs haven't broken the mask yet, Kitsu Ichika will instruct them to do so and attacks if the PCs are not willing to comply.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Tunnels</span></h2><p>AiR p.377</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The tunnels consist of a labyrinthine collection of underground passages. Some are natural, and some have been painstakingly excavated over the course of hundreds of years. The Hiruma have heavily fortified these tunnels with chokepoints, traps, barricades, and other strategic means for taxing or delaying assaults. These defenses face outward, making them ineffective against attacks coming from within the castle itself. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Since the lanterns are sparsely placed, the tunnels under Daylight Castle are considered to be in dim lighting unless the PCs have another method of lighting their path. The tunnels perpetually stink of mildew and rot. If the GM desires, the PCs might encounter Giant Spiders (stats available in the SRD) while they move through the tunnels. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Barricades </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">There are three main barricades in the tunnels. An assortment of three to five defenders including Undying Defenders (see page 382), Undying Sergeants (see page 382), and Undying Purifiers (see page 383) are stationed at each barricade. One barricade is located near a poisonous gas trap (DC 12 Wisdom saving throw to detect, creates a 20-foot sphere of poisonous gas that inflicts 1d6 poison damage on any creature that starts its turn inside of it), one is near a spiked pit (DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move past without falling in, 10-foot square that inflicts 1d4 piercing damage and the bleeding condition for one minute on any creature that falls in), and one is at a bottleneck near the hidden courtyard, behind heavy fortifications (DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check to spot, any creature in the bottleneck has –2 AC for attacks made by the defenders). Each barricade location is scattered with the bodies of fallen undead and Lost Samurai that have tried again and again to storm the defenses without achieving any measurable success. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The State of the Seals </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If one of Daylight Castle’s magical seals has been broken, the tunnels are full of pitched battles between the Lost and the castle’s defenders. The Undying Defenders will ignore the PCs in this situation unless the PCs attack them. PCs may choose to aid the defenders. If they do, after the battle, the Undying Defenders will tell the PCs to leave but won’t attack them unless the PCs attack first. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If both seals have been broken, the Undying Defenders are quickly overrun by the Lost forces. The PCs arrive at the scene just in time to see a trio of Lost Samurai striking a fatal blow against the last Undying Defender before they turn their attention to the PCs. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Iron and Jade Veins</span></h3><p>AiR p.378</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">PCs exploring the tunnels may encounter areas rich with iron veins and nodes of jade. When the PCs find such an area, one PC can make a DC 14 Strength check to extract jade with various rusted mining tools scattered around. If the PC is proficient with relevant artisan tools such as masonry tools, they add their proficiency bonus to the check. On failure, they cannot extract anything from the node. On success, the PC extracts 1d4–1 fingers of jade, to a minimum of 1. In either case, each node can be mined only once. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Invaders’ Camp </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">At the rear of the tunnels, there is a small camp containing Lost Samurai, undead minions, and the renegade Kitsu Ichika. If the PCs have broken any seals or eliminated any defensive positions in the tunnels, she will congratulate the PCs on their role in the fall of the castle and the oni’s glorious return. If the PCs have not allied themselves with the oni, she will try to convince them to serve the oni by offering riches and power. If the PCs refuse, she and her followers will attack.

This was once the waiting chamber meant to keep the remains of fallen samurai until they were able to be cremated. It has been repurposed as a prison by the Undying Defenders. Here, they have hidden away the body of the oni in order to limit its influence since it has proven to be dangerous and impossible to destroy through conventional means. Cutting pieces of the oni’s flesh off results in separate sentient pieces, as found throughout Daylight Castle. The body of the oni is locked in a tomb, wrapped in chains and protective wards, and is attended by two Undying Purifiers. They become hostile if the PCs attempt to interact with the tomb or if they are provoked. Their primary focus seems to be performing invocations to divert the miasma leaking from the tomb.</span></p>",

Of course, PCs being PCs, the GM might have to extrapolate a climax based on unexpected decisions, but most of these can be deployed in one or more ways, as described below. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Summoning the Oni </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs have unwittingly unleashed the oni by shattering its mask, read or paraphrase the following aloud when they break its mask: </span></p><blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As you shatter the glossy red mask, an unnerving sound, or perhaps the utter absence of sound, rips through the room like a void being opened. It is painfully loud and silent all at once, making you want to reach to cover your ears and shield your mind from the reality-bending phenomenon. You feel a distinct chill fill the room as a guttural, inhuman roar replaces the perplexing sound from before. The oni has been unleashed, and it has had hundreds of years to delight in what it plans to do next. </span></p></blockquote><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The oni calls itself “The Amalgamation,” for it sups eternally upon the experience and memories of those it devours. It demands the PCs bow before it. Once free, its first order of business is to bind itself back into its body so it can regain its power. The fleshy masses throughout the castle are slurped up into its soul and reshaped into an imposing creature that resembles a gigantic human but is beastlike in stance and mannerisms. The Amalgamation oni (see page 384) then seeks out the PCs to “thank” them for their efforts. In battle, it is accompanied by two Tentacle Horrors (see page 384). Slaying the oni without the cursed katana results in its soul being sucked back into the broken mask, which then magically mends itself, returning the situation to the prior status quo. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Slaying the oni with the cursed katana permanently banishes it back to Jigoku. Use the Amalgamation oni NPC stats found on page 384.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rescue Mission</span></h2><p>AiR p.379</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Upon discovering Asahi being held prisoner in the samurai quarters, it’s possible the PCs will try to escape with him instead of further investigating the happenings at Daylight Castle. If they would like to do this, Asahi is more than happy to comply, as he desperately wants to be rescued and doesn’t want to be responsible for guarding the oni’s mask if it means sacrificing the comfortable life waiting for him back home. However, escaping the castle might prove difficult. If the PCs have weakened the castle’s seals, Kitsu Ichika and several of her Lost Samurai cronies (see page 385) might already be storming in to free her oni overlord, and she will not hesitate to attack them if they cross paths. On the other hand, if the wards are still active, the PCs might well find Hiruma Tomoharu (see page 383) and several Undying Defenders (see page 382) standing in their way instead, demanding that Asahi fulfill his destiny. In either case, the PCs will be in for a difficult fight to escape. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Passing the Torch </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs persuade Asahi to wear the mask and assume the role of daimyō of Daylight Castle, the immediate threat of the oni is diminished severely. With time, Asahi will be able to rally and rebuild the defenses of the castle, but will effectively be condemned to carry this heavy burden, which will result in his eventual exhaustion and death, hopefully once another has taken the helm of the vigil in a few hundred years. However, as the ritual to transfer the mask takes place, Kitsu Ichika (see page 385) storms into the castle to stop it, and the PCs must at least stall her in battle until the ritual is complete. This takes 6 rounds, or concludes if the PCs are victorious in battle. The PCs can still attempt to banish the oni for good with Kitsu Ichika’s cursed katana after they choose this option, or they might consider it a job well done and leave Asahi to his fate. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Collateral Damage </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs wish to follow Masami’s self-sacrificing strategy, they can stab the mask with the cursed katana. Doing so will banish both the souls of Masami and the oni to Jigoku, but also pull the PCs into a waking dreamworld at the fringe of the realm of Dreams. There, they must fight the oni’s soul, which takes the form of the false Masami. In this form, the oni uses the wicked sorcerer profile from page 402 with Mockery of Truth as its heretical art and access to the legendary actions possessed by the oni on page 384. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Legendary Heroism</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The PCs might elect to listen to Hiruma Tomoharu’s plan and travel to the secret chamber and break the mask with a weapon other than the cursed katana, releasing the soul of the oni back into its body. The soul of Masami will float away to await reincarnation in the next realm. As Masami escapes when the mask is broken, the PCs hear the gentle flapping of moths’ wings and gain a blessing of 10 temporary hit points each to fortify them in their fight against the oni. Freed, the Amalgamation oni’s soul will bind to its body (see page 384). The oni is accompanied by two Tentacle Horrors (see page 384). The PCs will need to defeat it in a battle for the ages! </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Friend of Evil </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If the PCs free the soul of the oni from the mask intentionally, its body will burst from the tomb in the secret chamber before seeking out the PCs. It will then congratulate them on the role they have played in its freedom and ask the PCs to pledge their loyalty to it and serve in the memory of Fu Leng. If the PCs agree, they are each given 500 gp and gain the Shadowlands Might feat (see page 224), and must face the remaining forces in the castle to secure it as the oni’s seat of power. Alternately, if they refuse, the oni attacks them as in the above scenarios.</span></p><blockquote><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>Failure Is An Option</em></span></h1><p><em>AiR p.379</em></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\"><em>This adventure presents the PCs with many challenges, some of them potentially quite difficult.

This means they will all leave their decaying bodies and submit themselves to reincarnation. With the castle effectively empty, it is prone to become overrun by Shadowlands creatures.

As you grow nearer, the gate opens, and a merry host of Crab Clan samurai await you with celebratory roars and strong sake. Hiruma Yoshino stands at the helm, her eyes bright and brimming with tears at the sight of you, as if she never dared to dream you might actually return.
