It is recommended that you read the Introduction for a basic introduction of Rokugan and safety tools, then read all of the player resources to get a sense of the options available, as some are quite different from the options available in the SRD. When creating a character, select a species, background, class, equipment, and two motivations for your character based on your character concept. Talk to your GM about these choices, especially your motivations, and how they might fit into the themes the GM has planned for the campaign. Your GM decides whether character options from the SRD and other 5e books are available to you.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As a GM, the second portion of <strong>Adventures in Rokugan</strong> is where you can find most of the information for running the game, but the entire volume contains helpful information. Read the <strong>Introduction</strong> for a basic overview of Rokugan and safety tools, then read all of the player resources, paying special attention to <strong>Motivations</strong>, as these are one way your players can signal the story themes they are interested in exploring. Then read the GM resources, with a focus on A<strong>dventuring in Rokugan</strong> for the paradigm of play and <strong>History of Rokugan</strong> to see if any of the campaign flashpoints are interesting to you and your players. Finally, read through <strong>A Grim Inheritance</strong> if you are looking for a prewritten option to begin your <strong>Adventures in Rokugan</strong>!</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">What Do Characters Do In Adventures in Rokugan?</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Two forms orbit a room, blades drawn and eyes fixed on each other. Their footsteps are light, and in the quiet they prepare for minutes of combat to settle decades of dispute. Onlookers press themselves into the corners of the room to avoid becoming collateral damage. Everyone waits for the first strike, which inevitably comes from the indignant young man wielding two swords in a flurry of steel. The eyes of the small crowd quickly shift from him to the resolute older duelist as she evades each attack with ease. She shifts her weight in a calculated dance, dodging and parrying as her white braids flow behind her like ribbons. The right moment shows itself, and with a single offensive blow, she will irrevocably resolve their disagreement. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">At the border of the Shadowlands, an acolyte on night watch crouches behind a boulder to assess their prey. The hulking monster trudges toward the camp where their crew unwittingly slumbers. In the dark, the acolyte is near invisible, yet a faint glow emanates from their skin. Tendrils of purple climb up their arms and neck, marking them as changed by the otherworldly power that undulates through the barren ground. As a thin fog rolls to meet the acolyte, they dissipate and let it carry them and their blade to the vile beast ahead. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">A naga stirs from his centuries of rest, high in the canopy of the Shinomen Forest. He uncoils himself from the branches of the tree and slithers to the ground. A disruptive force is felt like a whisper, a promise of peril to come. The shared dream fading from the naga’s mind beckons others. He can feel them moving through the forest, alert and ready to quell this new threat. With his hands pressed together, he closes his eyes and channels his magic, calling upon his ancestors to provide guidance and strength. Two translucent guardians climb from the damp ground and flank him. Imbued with ancient wisdom and fresh guile, the ritualist knows this war cannot be won alone. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Emerald Empire provides a dynamic Japanese-inspired fantasy setting for players to make their own legends. By creating and controlling characters, players can delve into a land brimming with delicate politics, powerful magic and deadly secrets. Whether the destiny awaiting your character is what you planned or something altogether serendipitous, there’s only one way to find out where the pull of destiny may lead them and their party. Ready your dice. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Whether you’re planning an intricate heist in the Esteemed Palaces of the Crane or journeying south to oust a diabolic scourge from the Shadowlands, your chances of success are greatly elevated with the right accomplices. Everyone has something to contribute, something to gain, and something to lose. How might your character’s motivations clash or coincide with those of their fellow adventurers? What lengths are they willing to go to in order to accomplish their goal? While the setting of the game provides context and opportunities for your adventure, the heart of the story is what your characters choose to do with the choices presented to them and how they grow into heroes or villains befitting of their grandest destiny.</span></p>",

These games have mechanics that strive to capture the essence of a samurai drama in an RPG experience, putting emphasis on political machinations, personal drama, and the ephemerality of life. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The book you hold in your hands, Adventures in Rokugan, has a different mission: to present a version of the Legend of the Five Rings setting that brings the best of the 5e experience to Rokugan. It focuses on heroic adventure, mythic battles inspired by folklore, and the larger-thanlife exploits of exceptional individuals, all of which are highlighted by the mechanics of the world’s most famous roleplaying game. Heroes might be members of the samurai clans iconic to L5R, but they might also be commoners, champions from faraway lands, or even members of other species not usually spotlighted in L5R. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The only thing that is true of all of the protagonists of Adventures in Rokugan is that they are adventurers. Whether they fight for ideals, glory, or gold, these heroes are like the characters of Rokugan’s folklore come to life, vanquishing monsters, completing quests, assisting those in need, and making a name for themselves that may resound across all of the Emerald Empire for centuries. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">For those unfamiliar with L5R, this makes Adventures in Rokugan a self-sufficient starting point, requiring only the knowledge of the setting contained in this book to play. Novels, books from the previous game lines, and other resources can be useful for inspiration, but are not required reading for GMs or players. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">For veteran L5R players, this means that the details of the setting may be slightly different than what you expect. The Great Clans, the founding of Rokugan, and the main themes are present, but the particulars presented here are designed to make the most of the 5e experience. Think of this as a new adaptation of Rokugan that is meant to be enjoyed alongside its precursors, exploring new story spaces that 5e’s mechanics facilitate while preserving the most important elements of the setting. GMs could even make Adventures in Rokugan part of an ongoing series of L5R campaigns, using it to create new myths and folktales of Rokugan that feature in their other stories.</span></p>",

Beyond the Carpenter Wall lies the Shadowlands, a land blighted by the influence of Hell itself, and dangerous for even the most legendary heroes to step foot within. At its widest point, Rokugan measures six hundred miles, from the Sea of the Sun Goddess in the east to the Burning Sands in the west. Within its borders, bountiful plains ripple gold in the sunlight, and primordial forests hide mysterious spirits and treacherous creatures.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The various clans that serve the Emperor are far from monolithic. Even within each clan’s specific culture, many families and individuals choose to deviate from the norm. While matters of philosophy and taste are largely inconsistent, one thing is universal in Rokugan: the value of a person’s character.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Chivalry is alive and well. Citizens of all genders are taught from a young age to stand up for what is right and protect their homeland until their dying breath. Doing so promises improvement in the circumstances of their next life. Some choose to serve the Emerald Empire by becoming soldiers, engineers, artisans, servants, and the like. Rarer, though not unheard of, are those who choose to make their own way by living the life of an adventurer. Whether this is out of a desire for spiritual enlightenment, exploration, completion of a quest, or perhaps even revenge, adventurers have made substantial contributions to Rokugan’s history.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">There is great need for heroism throughout the land. With the constant threat of the Shadowlands, many adventurers choose to travel south to conquer unholy menaces. Yet, there are pressing matters to attend to within any clan’s land and beyond. Some battles are fought with a quick wit and friends in high places. Quests often require investigative genius to secure important information, save innocents, or foil the nefarious plans of an enemy. Outright war occasionally looms on the horizon with clans clashing and bitterness working its way into the hearts of influential lords. In the direst times, a courageous band of heroes is the only thing standing between the Emerald Empire and catastrophic ruin.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Magic and spiritual power have a substantial impact on Rokugan, even as it goes largely unseen by the masses. Those trained in invoking the spiritual powers are revered throughout Rokugan as the foremost among the land’s priests and religious authorities. Although this power is seen as wholesome and divine in origin, the same cannot be said of all such abilities. For those who seek the forbidden power of heretical sorcery have almost brought Rokugan to its knees more than once. The Phoenix Clan has the task of understanding and regulating mystical power within the Emerald Empire. Unsurprisingly, there has been centuries of debate on what types of magic should be acceptable in the Emerald Empire. The Unicorn Clan’s return with mysterious magics several centuries ago disrupted this status quo, and while some within the Emerald Empire are intrigued by the possibilities presented by this “way of names,” others believe it to be a dangerous threat to the realm’s spiritual stability. One thing is certain: magic is as important to Rokugan as any other precious resource and must be cultivated with care.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Folklore and mythology come to life within this world. While details of the origin story of Rokugan are sometimes argued by scholars, most agree that the arrival of Hantei and the other divine siblings was the beginning of what has become one of the most prosperous nations in the world. Legends are told of heroes that fought the odious host of Fu Leng, quelled rebellions led by would-be usurpers, and made impactful discoveries of science and magic. The skilled musicians of Rokugan’s courts continue to compose ballads of strife and victory. The Emerald Empire thrives on tales of valiant adventurers and there is always room for another. Destiny belongs to those brave enough to stride into the darkest night and persevere through failure to claim victory over all that dared stand in their way.</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Inspirations of Rokugan</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan is a fictional nation in a world of make-believe. Rokugan and its neighbors were inspired by the history, literature, and folklore of Japan, China, Korea, the Middle East, Mongolia, and India (to name just a few). However, these fictional realms deviate extensively from their real-life counterparts and are not meant to represent these real-world countries or their people. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While differences abound, it’s important to give credit where credit is due, and Adventures in Rokugan owes much of its compelling setting to Japan, China, Mongolia, and other Asian nations. Many themes, ideas, elements of material culture, and variations of religious doctrines within are not original to Adventures in Rokugan. Besides historical references, fiction from or inspired by these cultures are also influential in the formation of this setting.</span></p>",

Extensive knowledge of Asian history is not required to play, but we encourage players to research harmful stereotypes and their origins so they can be avoided.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">As well as showing respect to Asian cultures, we ask that GMs do not include sexual assault or suicide (including ritual suicide/seppuku) in their games. We never know what trauma our fellow players have been through, but the consequences of being insensitive and jovial about such topics can leave lasting wounds far after the conclusion of a game session.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">We would like to offer the following tips for safe, inclusive gameplay:</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Humanize your Asian characters</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">It's important to recognize the stereotypes of Asian people that exist, and avoid them in your game. Portraying characters who are unfeeling, consistently stoic, or motivated only by the idea of honor is not a fair representation, limits opportunities in gameplay, and perpetuates harmful stereotypes set by western media.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Please be equally considerate of other cultures presented in this game and do some research into how to interact with them respectfully should they be highlighted in your gameplay.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Don’t speak \"Asian-sounding\" gibberish as a way of pretending to speak a language you do not</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">This is extremely harmful. Please don't do it. Reference the included pronunciation guide and seek additional online resources if needed when learning to pronounce loan words used in the game. Perfect pronunciation is not expected, but please do your best and treat these languages with respect. On a related note, there is no need to use performative accents. Speaking or signing the common language among those at your table as you normally would is best.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Do not include ritual suicide in your games</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">We firmly believe the glorification of suicide as a method for redemption is wrong and can be harmful to players. Rokugan may share many cultural aspects of ancient Japan and other Asian cultures, but it does not mean harmful elements need to be included in this fantasy world.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Be respectful of religious elements</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Because inspiration for Rokugan is drawn from realworld sources—particularly Japan and China—many of the concepts and components presented here regarding shrines are similarly drawn from or inspired by Shintoism, Daoism, and Zen Buddhism. GMs and players should remain mindful of this and, during play, try to ensure that they and their characters interact with these concepts in ways that won’t cause offense. Remember that even if you or your character do not consider something to be sacred, others do, and it’s important to be considerate of how others worship.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Be mindful</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Think before you speak. Try to be aware of what others find hurtful. We recommend having a group discussion on mindfulness before the game begins. Topics may include: stereotypes to avoid, what triggers members of the group would like to omit, and how the group would like to address issues during gameplay, should they arise. Taking the time to have this conversation at the beginning and in a refresher capacity whenever needed helps make sure everyone is having a good experience!</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Don't try to explain someone else's culture to them</span></h2><p>AiR p.11</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">If you are not of a background or identity being marginalized/misrepresented at your table, do not argue with players of those backgrounds/identities you have offended. No one is sensitive for no reason. Pain from racism is real and valid. Drop your armor class and seek to understand before causing further damage with your words.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Understand that you may mess up</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Racism in all its ugly forms has run rampant in western society for generations. Much of what we understand to be facts are actually falsehoods concocted with a particular agenda in mind. War-era propaganda and tasteless media continue to impact how Asians are viewed. You may occasionally perpetuate a stereotype without meaning to. When you do and it is brought to your attention, please educate yourself. It is only through this process of internal change that we can slowly crush the formidable foe of systemic racism.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Commit to growth</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">It's easy to feel embarrassed or even angry about being called out for hurting someone. If you have reflected, understood, apologized, and been forgiven, don't let feelings of guilt drive you away from the game table. Take accountability for your mistake and commit to doing better. This is often all it takes to move forward.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">*Though this book has undergone extensive review by Asian contributors, please note that we may have accidentally included harmful elements. Not all marginalized voices share the same perspectives, but all marginalized voices are valid.

The macron, or long bar over a vowel, indicates that the vowel sound is held for a moment longer, as in rōnin, or “ro-oh-neen.” </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan’s neighboring lands described in later parts of this book are noted as being inspired by other real-world places and cultures, and so the pronunciation of terms originating from those fictional lands should be informed by pronunciation for the related real-world languages.</span></p>",

        "content": "<p>AiR p.12</p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Basics of Rokugan</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Emerald Empire is the political power that rules Rokugan, and at the top of it sits the Hantei dynasty. The Empire has withstood war, supernatural turmoil, and chaos, and is still strong over a thousand years after its foundation. The lands of the Emerald Empire are divided between the seven Great Clans: the Crab, the Crane, the Dragon, the Lion, the Phoenix, the Scorpion, and the Unicorn. Each of these clans controls a significant portion of the Empire in the name of the Imperial ruler.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Geography and Early History</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan is one of many countries in a fantasy world that draws some inspiration from our own but diverges from reality. Although other countries exist in this world, Adventures in Rokugan is, unsurprisingly, focused on Rokugan. The Emerald Empire was established after Hantei and his divine siblings fell into the Mortal Realm and encountered humans in this strange new realm. These people consisted of groups that had inhabited the region for millennia and those who had arrived from surrounding lands more recently.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">After the celestial siblings fell from the Heavens, they united the people and organized them into the Great Clans that endure to this day. Fu Leng, the wayward brother who fell all the way through the Mortal Realm to the depths of the underworld, wielded the insidious power of the Shadowlands to launch an attack against his siblings and their followers. Conquering him and his heinous legions forged a bond between the clans that has held fast through the ages. Though interclan tensions continuously ebb and flow over the centuries, in times of great crisis, the Great Clans come together for the good of the realm.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Organization of Government</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In Rokugan, it is said that devotion is stronger than steel. While even the finest blade can bend and break under the heat of the forge, the Emerald Empire’s society has been folded in the forges of politics and war for more than a thousand years, and it has not yet broken due to the fortitude of its people.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">All Imperial authority and patterns of life proceed from the Hantei, the Emperor, who is descended from divinity and sits on the Emerald Throne. History has seen emperors of all genders accompanied by one or more romantic partners of various backgrounds. In official matters, the Emperor is attended primarily by their Emerald Champion and the champions of the Great Clans. There are seven Great Clans and various minor, less prominent clans that have jurisdiction over different regions of the land, though the Imperial Court’s laws are enforced everywhere and supersede local legislature. The Clan Champions are masters of the Great Clans, overseeing the many families sworn to each. These families are descended from the heroic mortals who swore fealty to the celestial siblings in ancient times.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The seven Great Clans are powerful, culturally distinctive entities that preside over each of their portions of the Empire, protecting the natural harmony of the land and the people that dwell there. Shrines and temples dot the landscape, marking places of spiritual power and contemplation. In the shadows of the clan palaces, towns and villages prosper from the efforts of craftspeople and artisans. Beyond the city limits, peasants harvest grain, fish, hunt, and gather the bounty of the forests.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan is a feudal society: all of the land belongs to the Emperor, who bestows the rights of stewardship on champions and lords within the Great Clans, who in turn pass on the tasks of administration to lesser-ranked samurai. Though some are warriors, “samurai” means “one who serves,” and refers to all who rule the Emerald Empire as nobles and lords, as well as their retainers and vassals. Some samurai wield immense power, while others have little save their names.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The various families within the clans are themselves ruled over by daimyō, lords of the families, who direct their kin in all manner of endeavors and expect absolute respect. Their individual lands are divided into provinces, the divisions of land in Rokugan, which are ruled over by lesser daimyō—who themselves rule over district and city governors, lords of rich lands and wealthy cities. The clans and their representatives vie for dominance in the courts of these daimyō, prevailing over others with wit, decorum, and strategic offerings.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Citizens of the Emerald Empire</span></h2><p>AiR p.12</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">White the Hantei and members of the Imperial Court occupy the most prestigious roles in the Emerald Empire, samurai are also highly regarded by the majority of those under them.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Where do Adventurers Fit into Society?</span></h2><p>AiR p.14</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The title of adventurer holds little weight if one’s name is not associated with grand deeds. Adventuring is not for the faint of heart. Many set forth to change the world and soon return home with devastating injuries and wounded pride. Those who are able to persevere through the arduous first year of their travels often choose to continue adventuring until they die. Some adventurers are fallen samurai who have failed to act in accordance with their high station and can no longer command trust and respect from their subordinates. Some are samurai who found their occupations unappealing and forsook their advantageous lifestyles in search of something more exciting. Even greater in number are adventurers born of humble beginnings who hope to make a name for themselves or rescue their families from poverty.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Though adventuring has become increasingly popular in recent times, the vast majority of people in Rokugan are peasants who keep the nation running by cultivating the land, crafting tools, weapons, and implements, building homes, temples and palaces, and transporting goods across the Empire by land and sea.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Farmers who grow grains, vegetables and fruit, fishers, and hunters are considered the most important commoners. Below those that feed the Emerald Empire are the craftspeople: carpenters, blacksmiths, brewers, and practitioners of the other skilled trades. Below them all are merchants, not well regarded by all others since they do not actually make anything themselves, but profit off the labor and talents of others.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Seldom permitted to carry weapons (save for peasant military levies acting as armed retainers to samurai), peasants have few defenses, physically and legally. An adventurer might find a commoner calling upon them to advocate for their cause by word or by blade, especially if they have demonstrated their skills or have a reputation for heroism. Of course, enacting violence against the peasant’s lord could have disastrous consequences for both the peasant and the interfering adventurer, and so discretion can often be the better part of valor in these situations, and a well-placed word might do more work than a blade ever could.</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Crime and Punishment</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan’s laws forbid violent acts such as extortion, arson, assault, murder, and treason. Theft, fraud, tax evasion, and smuggling are also considered crimes, as are numerous other proscribed activities.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Some organized crime syndicates are able to operate in secrecy for a time, but the Emerald Champion and their magistrates are vigilant in seeking out these illegal factions and shutting them down. There is not currently an illegitimate force powerful enough to rival any of the Great Clans, although some choose to believe the Great Clan of the Scorpion is nothing more than a glorified band of criminals.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">To enforce laws and maintain an orderly society within their borders, provincial daimyō appoint investigators called magistrates. These magistrates are loyal to clan and daimyō, and are assisted by lesser-ranking samurai and armed peasant vassals in tracking and apprehending criminals. Historically, two classes of magistrate attended to Imperial crimes: Emerald Magistrates, appointed by the Emerald Champion, and Jade Magistrates, appointed by the Jade Champion. The former investigates secret societies and crimes crossing clan boundaries or involving national personages. The latter were ritualists tasked with investigating religious cults and heretical sorcery, but the office has not been filled in centuries due to a scandal involving a Jade Champion who was found practicing corrupted magic. It is said the position lends itself to too much temptation given the amount of confiscated magical artifacts and unnatural spellcraft that any person filling the Jade Champion position has access to. Currently, the use of arcane secrets deemed forbidden is reported to Emerald Magistrates, who are tasked with destroying items and apprehending those who practice such sorcery. Of course, the Emerald Magistrates are often ill-equipped to deal with such arcane problems, meaning that adventurers may find themselves asked to intervene when cursed artifacts are suspected or ancient evils run amok.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Crimes committed upward, or against the social order, are taken quite seriously by magistrates. Crimes committed downward, such as a samurai’s theft from a commoner, are less seriously investigated unless the commoner has the backing of another samurai or a helpful adventurer. If there is any doubt as to the samurai’s guilt, the defendant may challenge the offender to a duel, the winner of which is considered beyond reproach. Since most commoners lack formal education in dueling or combat in general, an adventurer may step in and duel on their behalf if they can find one who is willing. Those with more resources who are caught up in a criminal dispute, such as merchants and artisans, may call upon an esteemed investigator to intervene. If justice proves elusive, they may choose to hire a shinobi to “handle it.”</span></p><h2><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Celestial Order</span></h2><p>AiR p.15</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Belief and religion are inculcated into most samurai from birth. Spirits and gods are a fact of life, and faith is widespread—faith in the gods, faith in the cycle of reincarnation, and faith in the divine mandate that binds the Empire together.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">To many people in Rokugan, the Emperor is a divine being, charged by Lady Sun with overseeing the Mortal Realm. The histories of the Great Clans claim the blood of the divine siblings who founded Rokugan still runs through their veins. From the Emperor to a commoner, all are born with a sacred duty of the soul; the performance of this duty in life determines one’s judgment in the Realm of Waiting and potential rebirth into a higher or lower station.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Of course, not everyone ascribes to these beliefs exactly, and scholars of one tradition often differ from practitioners of another. Like any large country, Rokugan’s faith has a wide range of interpretations, some of which are more literal and others of which are more abstract.</span></p>",

This is the divinely appointed way of the Emerald Empire. Disputes of legitimacy are eliminated, and it equalizes the Great Clans with the precedent that none of them can have one of their own sit on the throne and promote their clan’s interests above others. Though the Imperial Consort may be of a specific clan, the Hantei are scrupulous in not showing favoritism.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">With so many generations of Hantei, innumerable siblings have become spare heirs who are never called upon to ascend the throne. Even within only a few generations, the number of royal heirs born to the Imperial family would require an entire city of palaces, and moreover, none but the Emperor and their immediate kin could use the Hantei family name. To manage this abundance of royals, these other heirs join peripheral Imperial families upon reaching adulthood. They serve as the heralds and bureaucrats of the Empire and the bodyguards and spiritual wardens of the Emperor.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Together, they are sworn to protect the political power of the Emperor and ensure no one clan grows too influential. At the faintest whisper of a coup, the Imperial families and their rumored spies are quick on the heels of usurpers. Conspiracy theories suggest they have even, from time to time, been accused of working with the Scorpion Clan to secretly sabotage clans that become too ambitious as a preventative measure against insurrections.</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Great Clans</span></h1><p>AiR p.16</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In day-to-day life, the Great Clans are the most prominent political factions of the Emerald Empire. While they all answer to the Hantei Dynasty, the Great Clans handle the majority of governance of Rokugan. There are seven Great Clans, each founded by a divine sibling of the original Hantei during their time in Rokugan. The direct descendants of these celestial beings sit at the helm of their clans as ruling families. A large host of other families, both prominent and less notable, follow the tradition of their ancestors who, as mortals, swore fealty to the celestial champions and aided them in battle. The more prominent families have institutional power within their clans, but never enough to rival that of the divinely descended. Each clan has a military force consisting of thousands of troops.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Like vital organs, each Great Clan has a selfappointed role to play in keeping Rokugan safe, prosperous, and divinely favored. Most of the land in the Emerald Empire is divided among them in large parcels, except for land owned by the Imperial Court and smaller sections in which the Minor Clans reside. It is not uncommon for a samurai to be sent to serve in another organization or clan. Some samurai enjoy the chance to visit new lands and jump at the chance to work alongside people with different upbringings, while others see assignments far away from home as a form of soft political exile to squash their political ambitions.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Crab Clan</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Without the Crab Clan, the horrors of the Shadowlands would spill freely into Rokugan. Often, other clans see the Crab Clan’s dutiful warriors as lacking in glamor and refinement, but there is little space for frivolity when grotesque minions of the underworld constantly threaten the safety of Crab families. Large in stature and inelegant in speech, the ingenuity of the Crab is constantly underestimated by outsiders. The Carpenter Wall and siege weapons mounted on it are works of sophisticated engineering that must be upkept and adapted to stave off periodic and devastating waves enemies.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Crane Clan</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Home to masters of philosophy, theory, and artistic expression, the Crane Clan is often referred to as the Left Hand of the Emperor. Known also for their artistry, they boast a heavy influence on culture in Rokugan. The Crane Clan has cultivated the most prestigious poets, tailors, and painters. In addition to their cultural influence, the Crane Clan uses gifts and favors to build allegiances and strengthen key bonds within other organizations to secure the clan’s political power. The Crane Clan also boasts the most renowned duelists in Rokugan, giving them the edge in certain disputes resolved through the blade. Those unaffected by the magnetic allure of the Crane may view them as arrogant social climbers, but those who fail to recognize the clan’s subtle skill are sure to regret it.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Dragon Clan</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">For a thousand years, the Dragon Clan has watched over the others, recording the history of Rokugan with neutrality. Aloof and enigmatic, members of the Dragon Clan dedicate their lives to meditation and rigorous study. The armies of the Dragon rarely emerge from their mountain sanctuary, but occasionally have been known to intervene in conflicts between other clans for seemingly inscrutable reasons. From the enigmatic and powerful Togashi Tattooed Order to the investigators who challenge the system of justice in the Empire, the Dragon seek to ensure the Empire does not become too self-centered and solipsistic.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Lion Clan</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">For centuries, the Lion have dominated the military tactics and strategies of the Empire, pioneering new techniques and battle methods that other clans take years to adopt. If the Crane Clan is the Emperor’s Left Hand wielding cultural influence, the Lion Clan is the Right Hand wielding the military prowess to maintain a vast domain for centuries. Lion samurai seek to apply the wisdom of their ancestors to the trials of the modern era. Obedience and humility are essential in the Lion order. Nothing is done without a carefully configured plan, though at times, the mighty armies of the Lion Clan are said to have an appetence for bloodshed, mobilizing out of desire to prove themselves or demonstrate their skill instead of strict necessity.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Phoenix Clan</span></h2><p>AiR p.17</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The dealings of the Phoenix Clan transcend the Mortal Realm. As advocates of spirituality, they endorse various belief systems without a definitive preference. Many are scholars of Shinsei as well as servants of spirits, though not all choose these paths. Due to their great wisdom and revered connection to the divine, many in the Emerald Empire look to the Phoenix Clan for religious guidance. The Phoenix Clan also sees the protection of Rokugan from spiritual threats as part of its remit. To some members of the clan, this means learning as much as they can about new sources of spiritual power and unknown traditions, and sharing this knowledge for the betterment of the Empire. To others, this means sequestering dangerous arcane secrets at any cost and maintaining tight control over what magics can be practiced within Rokugan.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Scorpion Clan</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Historically seen as sinister by many members of the other Great Clans, the Scorpion Clan’s task is to do what must be done for the Emerald Empire to flourish—no matter the cost. Whether this means sabotaging members of the other Great Clans whose ambitions grow too great, going undercover to eliminate secretive threats to the Hantei Dynasty, or sacrificing personal ideals to protect society, the clan’s core philosophy weighs everything as a means to an end. Loyalty is at the heart of the Scorpion Clan. Of course, not every member of the clan lives up to this ideal of putting the wellbeing of the Emerald Empire above life, limb, and their own aspirations. Some members of the Scorpion Clan use their position, connections, and clandestine tactics to pursue their own ends—though such individuals must always watch their backs carefully, lest members of their own house deem such corruption intolerable to the Empire’s future.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Unicorn Clan</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Having journeyed beyond the borders of the Emerald Empire for centuries, the Unicorn Clan is uniquely aware of neighboring and remote nations. Seen as foreigners in their own land upon returning from their extensive travels by some, the Unicorn are often regarded with curiosity. Many among their ranks are mixed race and speak multiple languages. They are distinctive in their manner of dress, weaponry, variety of magic, and impressive cavalry. Acting as ambassadors for Rokugan, the Unicorn Clan works to reach new lands, find allies in the wider world, bring new information the Empire, spread cultural awareness, and promote understanding.</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Minor Clans</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Though the Great Clans are the most influential and dominant, the Minor Clans serve to fill meaningful gaps in what the Great Clans can offer Rokugan. Despite the disparity in their socioeconomic reach, the Minor Clans and Great Clans usually manage to coexist in harmony. Certain Minor Clans are offshoots of Great Clans, others are appointed by the Imperial Court to assume responsibility for a particular location, task, or secret, and some start as bands of retired adventurers looking to form their own Minor Clan.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Secret Societies</span></h1><p>AiR p.18</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Throughout history, secret societies and cults have influenced the destiny of Rokugan. Some cults are religious or philosophical in nature, while others are focused on the practice of heretical sorcery. Moon cults worship Lord Moon and often revel in chaos, but are legally tolerated in many places due to Lord Moon’s divinity. On the other hand, sects of necromancers and blood sorcerers and others who wield vile magic are pursued by the Emerald Magistrates and the Phoenix Clan for the terrible danger they pose to the citizenry of Rokugan.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Other Inhabitants</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan is home to many species besides the humans that dwell therein. Among the most prominent are naga, nezumi, tengu, and yōkai. Some humans, who live their entire lives within their clan’s cities and villages, incorrectly assume these species are myth alone, but others, especially adventurers, are privy to their existence. Adventurers tend to treat these ethereal beings with respect and awe. Few humans are privileged to establish familiarity with them and if affronted, these beings become formidable foes.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Factions Beyond</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rokugan is not the only nation born to the world it resides in. Though it is relatively introverted, the Emerald Empire conducts trade with neighboring lands and makes an effort to foster fellowship with its peers. Neighboring regions and nations include Yún Fēng Guó, Saebyuksan, the Plains of Wind and Stone, the Ivory Kingdoms, and the Qamarist Caliphate. Currently, Rokugan is not at war with any of these nations and is closely cooperative with the Ujik and the Ivory Kingdoms by way of the Unicorn and Crab Clans, respectively.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Foreign travelers pass through Rokugan for a variety of reasons and are generally well-received by the people of the Emerald Empire. International relations are typically managed by the Unicorn Clan, but the Imperial Court always makes its will known in matters it deems especially important. Powerful alliances can be made and lost under difficult circumstances, and the Unicorn Clan is dedicated to securing strong partnerships near and far.</span></p>",

This section covers the basics of the cosmos as the people of Rokugan understand it.</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Founding Myth</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Since the beginning of time, Lord Moon has chased Lady Sun around the world. One day, he caught her, and as her light faded, the curtain fell on the age of the ancient species. Over the course of countless seasons, Lady Sun gave birth to nine children: Hida, Doji, Shinjo, Togashi, Akodo, Shiba, Bayushi, Fu Leng, and Hantei. Lord Moon knew that any children whose veins carried both elements of Sun and Moon would grow to be greater than he, and so he swallowed the children, one by one, until only the youngest remained. Lady Sun, in an act of desperation, fled with her remaining child, Hantei. She wept heavily for the loss of eight of her children, and her tears fell down from the Heavens. Lady Sun trained Hantei in the martial arts so that one day, he could confront his jealous father.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">When Hantei and Lord Moon finally battled, Hantei sliced open his father’s belly, and his siblings tumbled out unharmed. Then, they fell from the sky safely to the Mortal Realm, save for one. Fu Leng plunged all the way through the Mortal Realm to the Realm of Torment, Hell itself, where he was lost. The blood from Lord Moon’s wound dripped down to the Mortal Realm. In some places, the blood of Lord Moon mixed with Lady Sun’s tears, and from that mingling came the first humans. The siblings wept for their brother who had fallen, but most of them quickly shifted their focus to what they saw as more pressing matters.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">No longer immortal, they shared the Mortal Realm with humans. The divine siblings resolved to teach and guide these humans, and they held a great tournament to see who would lead those who lived in this land they dubbed Rokugan. All of the siblings, save for Togashi—who could foresee the outcome—competed against one another in a test of cleverness, grace, speed, wisdom, and combat. Hantei emerged victorious and became the first Emperor. The rest founded clans to serve Hantei and recruited humans to organize under them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The influence of Jigoku had slowly spread from the fissure in the Mortal Realm opened by Fu Leng’s fall from the Heavens, and through the very place he descended, he climbed back into the world where his siblings had made themselves rulers. Demons followed in his shadow and he welcomed them. Outraged upon discovering no search had been conducted to rescue him, he assumed it was because Hantei was worried he might have bested him in the tournament for Emperor. Fu Leng challenged him to a duel for the throne. Hantei accepted and named Togashi as his champion. Knowing the result of the duel would have a profound impact on the mortals under their custodianship, Togashi chose all of Rokugan as his weapon, that the noble souls of their land might fight for their own destiny. Fate, he said, favors mortal hands. Fu Leng, in his twisted anger, raised the legions of Hell to meet the armies of Rokugan, and so began the War against Fu Leng. The Seven Thunders, one mortal hailing from each clan, became the heroes that conquered Fu Leng’s horde of evil and saved Rokugan from a devastating fate. Many adventurers revere the bravery and might of the Seven Thunders and zealously seek to become like them.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Founding Myth is just that, a myth. It is shrouded in the ages of the past, and though it is believed by many with fervor, certain details lead others to believe it may not be entirely factual. For instance, mortals of various species, including some humans, have recorded histories that pre-date the arrival of the divine siblings in Rokugan.</span></p><h1>The Realms of the Cosmos</h1><p>AiR p19 - @UUID[.YWPLL64hpH1VnkUS]{The Celestial Realms (img)}</p><p>AiR p.20</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">These realms play a major role in the cosmology of Rokugan.

Souls either reincarnate in Mortal Realm if they haven’t completed their soul’s mission, or are sentenced to go elsewhere. Mortals are native inhabitants of Ningen-dō, but so too are other sentient species like naga, nezumi, and tengu, various elemental spirits that exist as manifestations of the natural world, and other entities that are far from mundane. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Celestial Realms Above </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">These realms float above the Mortal Realm and are the domain of deities and celestial beings.

From the Celestial Court, the Elemental Dragons track their winding paths across the sky to regulate the cycles of the seasons and weather, while the Celestial Court's other denizens, the shinzoku, tend to the tasks of leading all sentient beings toward wisdom and their ultimate destinies and of generally keeping the cosmos in working order. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Yomi, the Realm of Blessed Ancestors. </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Set just below the Celestial Court, but still within its bounds, is the Realm of Blessed Ancestors. Souls who have reincarnated countless times and ultimately achieved their destinies are permitted into the paradise of the Realm of Blessed Ancestors, from which they can watch over their descendants in the Mortal Realm and guide the mortals who dwell there. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Enigmatic Realms Beside </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">These realms exist parallel to the Mortal Realm, overlapping in places with the world in which humans walk. Pathways into these realms can be found in ancient wilds, forgotten ruins, and even hidden back-alleys in cities that one can only find on moonless nights. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Senkyō, the Enchanted Country. </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Overlapping with the Mortal Realm is a place of sentient animals and shapeshifting tricksters. This realm is divided into two courts: Chikushō-dō, the Animals’ Path, is the philosophy animals should seek a reincarnation further up the Celestial Order, and Sakkaku, the Path of mischief (or Illusion), is the domain of those who embrace the form of animals and play jokes and tricks on other mortals while seeking the power to break the cycle of rebirth, so that they may remain as animals forever. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Yume-dō, the Realm of Dreams. </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Realm of Dreams is a place of fantasy and hidden truth, of what was and what may yet be. Its connection to the Mortal Realm is poorly understood, but one cannot exist without the other. Mortals visit the Realm of Dreams in their sleep, and some can travel there with talent or training. Noble ancestors of various species, especially the nezumi, retire to this realm after their final death and guide their descendants through dreams. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Underworld Realms Below </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The underworld realms exist below Rokugan. Wanderers might stumble into these realms in caverns, deep ravines, or in places marked by violence or outpourings of negative emotions. In the underworld realms, spiritual overseers such as the Fortune of Death maintain cosmic order and purify wicked mortal souls of their misdeeds. These deities work with the help of mazoku, demonic bureaucrats who are sometimes sent to the Mortal Realm to return wayward souls to their rightful place. However, the underworld realms are also gripped by conflict. Fu Leng’s fall into the Realm of Torment twisted his anguish into a terrible animating force, and many mazoku and other underworld spirits sided with him to challenge the Judgment Overlord. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Realm of Waiting. </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Realm of Waiting is where all beings go when they die. Souls are judged in the Realm of Waiting and then reincarnate or are sent to another realm. Countless mazoku organize and process the cosmic paperwork needed for souls to be reincarnated into another realm. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Realm of the Hungry Dead. </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">This is a realm of punishment for souls who could not be satisfied in life: the greedy, the lustful, the gluttonous, and the power hungry. Their fixation on conquest caused them to neglect their soul’s destiny, their desires growing until they could not be sated, and so they have been relegated to this realm where nothing satisfies. </span></p><h3><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Realm of Slaughter. </span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">This is the realm of punishment intended for the violent and the cruel. The Realm of Slaughter is a never-ending battlefield where punished souls fight in unending wars, dying and rising again and again.

Spirits of one’s forebears watch over their descendants, receiving prayer for guidance, aid, and good fortune. Nearly every house in Rokugan contains an ancestral shrine where family members offer prayer and dedication to stone statues of kin, asking for blessings, protection, and intercession. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Beyond the spirits of their own, the people of Rokugan revere and appease the elemental spirits of nature, agriculture, and other domains. This worship of the immortals who dwell in the Celestial Court and the myriad lesser spirits dwelling in the Mortal Realm is known as Fortunism. Temples and shrines to the Lesser Fortunes exist in the hundreds, and the sanctuaries celebrating the Eight Great Fortunes dominate the skylines of the Empire’s greatest cities.</span></p><h1><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The Fortunes of Rokugan</span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Many powerful Fortunes, or gods, exist. The Judgment Overlord reigns supreme over the Realm of Waiting in his role as Fortune of Death and Judge of the Dead, while the Fortune of Heroic Guidance often appears to aid novice adventurers throughout the Empire. Some theologians believe that all of the Fortunes were originally mortals whose deeds were cause for veneration, and that path is still attainable today. Whether through proving oneself a true paragon or treading other, secret paths, new gods can ascend to the Heavens. Eight particularly prominent Fortunes have many shrines across Rokugan.

Titanic fireballs, weaving beautiful illusory displays, creating great fissures in rock, or washing away the despair of battle—with the proper prayers, such incredible acts are possible. </span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Foreign Religions </span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Inhabitants of faraway lands have their own religious beliefs, origin stories, and practices.

However, focusing on this theme alone can sometimes leave campaigns feeling flat and predictable. Nuance and variation make any narrative more compelling. The following are common themes in <strong>Adventures in Rokugan</strong> that can be incorporated into campaigns to create more texture and depth. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Choosing one or multiple themes to enhance a campaign or individual character arc is essential in providing meaning and tension. Themes influence everything in a story. Paying special attention to the role of themes can help GMs and players identify what types of campaigns they would like to play. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Love</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Familial love, platonic love, romantic love, there are endless possibilities for how love changes and strengthens characters. Defying logic and self-interest, love is a powerful motivator that can drive someone to do just about anything they would never typically do. On the contrary, exploring how the lack of love can change a person is a poignant but meaningful route to pursue. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Heroism </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Choices must be made, often between an easy and morally devoid path or a difficult and upright path leading to greatness. To become a legend, one must be willing to lose everything they hold dear and be transformed by the heat of the forge. Their mission is simple: spare the innocent and punish the servants of evil, yet the nearly insurmountable odds require them to search deep within themselves for strength and resolve. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Devotion </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Loyalty and service to the gods and to one’s sovereign leader gives life a profound sense of purpose. What is a character willing to sacrifice for the greater good? How strong is their commitment? How deep is their faith? What happens when a truth is revealed that doesn’t align with what they believe? Do they continue on with blind trust or question everything and pivot their goals? </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Exploration </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Whether it involves entering uncharted lands, mingling with majestic species, or visiting impressive landmarks, explorers thrive on pursuing new opportunities. Some adventurers set out to achieve a specific end, others leave what they know for the journey itself. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Self-Discovery </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Identity is complex and takes time to establish. Characters who don’t feel they fit in where they are might feel inclined to leave their home and become better acquainted with themselves out in the open world. Coming of age stories centered around adolescents are popular, but a turning point in self-discovery can occur at any age, even moments before old age has claimed one’s mortal body. Particularly important is the determination of one’s ultimate destiny of their soul, which can take many lifetimes to discern. Accomplishing this personal duty leads to the transcendence of the soul and the triumphant end to their cycle of reincarnation. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Impermanence </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The cycle of life, death, and rebirth is inevitable for almost all souls. Nothing in the Mortal Realm lasts forever. Being able to move through changes with grace and resilience is a learned skill. Letting go is a necessary step in preparation for greater things.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Ambition</span></h2><p>AiR p.23</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">One cannot control the circumstances they are born into, but they can, in most cases, force the hand of fate in their favor. For some, there are limits to how much they can rise. For others, the possibilities are endless. Does a character choose to labor and toil for a better future, or manipulate others to create opportunities for themself? Is ambition their rise to fame, fall from grace, or perhaps, both? </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Flawed Belief </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Everyone has an inner obstacle that stems from a misbelief about themselves or the world around them. How does this misbelief change the way a character interacts with others? What do they have to unlearn in order to prosper and find true happiness? What made them believe this in the first place? Overcoming a flawed belief leads characters to grow into who they are meant to be. This deep introspection is typically achieved in times of great danger, when a character must dissolve their misunderstanding of themselves or the world in order to save a friend or defeat a foe. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Survival </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Grimmer yet are tales of survival. In a brutal world where the odds are immensely stacked against a person or group of people, there is no guarantee of living to see another day. Poverty, natural disasters, and oppression can threaten a character to the point of desperation. How do they survive? Who do they need to convince to help them? Is more than death itself at stake?</span><br style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;orphans:2;text-align:-webkit-auto;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px\" /></p>",

The Code of Akodo and Teachings of Shinsei are prominent ancient texts containing philosophies many citizens of Rokugan strive to emulate. For the spiritually inclined, Fortunism and the guidance of watchful ancestors assist in finding inner peace and power. Many seek a deep connection with nature and its teachings through The Way of the Five Rings. Devotion to these schools of thought varies widely. Some adhere to their belief systems strictly while others leave more room for interpretation. Each clan has a unique culture unto itself, and the popularity of these fundamental belief systems ebbs and flows from person to person. </span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Code of Akodo </span></h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Akodo was the founder of the Lion Clan and the most celebrated war hero in all of Rokugan’s recorded history. While his methods weren’t always beyond reproach, Akodo’s skill on the battlefield and strategic genius were nothing short of legendary. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">There is perhaps no text with a greater influence on Rokugan than Akodo’s Leadership. Written after the War against Fu Leng, Leadership collects Akodo’s thoughts and experience, both tactical and spiritual, into a single volume. Akodo codified his views on the warrior spirit and presented it as something more than a simple code of ethics, but an entire way of life. Over time, Leadership established how members of Rokugan’s ruling class perceived themselves and the world around them. As the culture of Rokugan evolved, so did Leadership. There have been too many abridgements and additions to count, but the heart of the text remains true to the spirit of Akodo. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">While the Code of Akodo as outlined in Leadership was designed with samurai in mind, much of the wisdom within is widely applicable. When contradictions occur within it, samurai must choose how best to preserve their values given the circumstances. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Many non-samurai citizens and adventures subscribe to an expanded set of tenets laid out in a famous commentary on Leadership by distinguished adventurer Kitsuki Emika, who highlighted such societal values as Filial Piety, Accountability, Justice, Faithful Friendship, Wisdom, and Ritual Propriety as standing alongside Akodo’s virtues of Compassion, Courage, Loyalty, and Sincerity in importance. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Compassion </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Learning compassion is essential for the progression of a soul. The practice of brotherly love lends support to strangers, neighbors and sometimes, even sworn enemies. True compassion is a gift given without the expectation of reciprocation. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Courage </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Courage is seen as both initiative and restraint. Knowing when to take action and having the conviction to do so is a useful trait in anyone, especially adventurers. Sometimes, getting involved in certain unfavorable situations might only make them worse. Courage is accepting a duel to clear the name of a friend, but sometimes, it is declining a duel with a deceitful enemy lord knowing mockery may follow.</span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Filial Piety</span></h2><p>AiR p.24</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Each family has unique challenges, expectations, duties, and desires. Adventuring samurai who serve outside of their families must learn to prioritize the will of their lords. Adventurers who are not sworn to a lord may freely pursue the interests of their own families. Choosing a path one’s family deems unsuitable does not make someone a bad person, though it can cause grief for everyone involved. Becoming an adventurer creates barriers to fulfilling familial responsibilities, but it is expected that adventurers do their best to make sure their families are well while they are away. This can mean making contributions by sending money home or returning home when someone is ill or in a dangerous situation. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Courtesy </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Upholding tradition and incorporating manners into daily interactions communicates depth of character in Rokugan. Especially in court, there are unspoken rules that determine acceptable behavior. A small misstep could have lasting consequences among nobility. To be successful in the art of persuasion, one must understand how to play the game and play it well. Insults are often veiled, and praise is inflated to disarm others. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Loyalty </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Loyalty to the Empire, Emperor, and one’s lord, if applicable, is seen as one of the most fundamental qualities in a citizen of Rokugan. To betray such loyalty is punishable by death or banishment. Many adventurers aren’t under the commission of a lord, but are still bound to clan and Empire obligations. Whether loyalty should be sacrificed to do what is right, if one must take priority, is a controversial topic. While most believe doing what is right is the correct path, the Scorpion Clan vows unfailing loyalty to the Empire regardless of the confines of conscience. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Accountability </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Humility in accepting one’s own mistakes clears the way for personal growth and improvement. Punishment tends to be less severe with a personal confession rather than denial paired with damning evidence. Through the act of confession, it is expected a fair amount of internal punishment takes place as a person reflects on their misdeeds. Such introspection is seen as greater than authoritative punishment because it is more likely to create lasting change in a person. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Justice </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Justice is subjective by nature, but the need for it is unequivocal. While there are standardized laws in Rokugan, the way each clan and lord enforce those laws may vary. Anyone who has pledged fealty to a lord is expected to subscribe to individual restrictions and duties their lord sets forth. Failure to do so often results in extreme punishment decided by the lord. Emerald Magistrates and justiciars keep the peace within Rokugan and mete out fines and sentences to those who steal, assault, kill, or otherwise break the law. These officials tend to be more objective and fairer than lords, as they are commissioned by a wise and altruistic Emerald Champion. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Sincerity </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">One’s word is taken extremely seriously. Written agreements are not typically seen as necessary in Rokugan because it’s rare for someone to go back on a promise. Courtiers are skilled in the arts of omission and deflection to deceive without being directly dishonest. This kind of verbal parrying is seen as clever and strategic within court, but is not generally appreciated elsewhere. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Faithful Friendship </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Friendship is especially important for adventurers. The transient lifestyle lends itself to loneliness and unnecessary risk if one does not seek out good company. Trading off for night watches is essential while exploring hostile environments, and a friend’s encouragement can sway the outcome of important duels. Friendships are rarely without imperfections, but learning to work together and trust one another is invaluable. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Wisdom </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Knowledge comes in many forms, and all are useful to an adventurer. Although some adventurers study their craft at colleges and academies, many set off without a formal education and learn as they go. Whether through study or experience, the pursuit of knowledge is a lifelong quest that leads one closer to eventual Enlightenment of their soul. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Ritual Propriety </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Rituals are an important part of life for many people in Rokugan. Even if one does not participate in the rituals themselves, they can support others in their religious and cultural traditions. Those sensitive to the spirits often take a strong interest in rituals. It is important to perform them in a correct manner. For example, one should not enter a temple before cleansing themselves. Worship at shrines can do much for the body and soul, even in dire times. Many adventurers don’t fully understand the Fortunes and elemental spirits, but still take time to ask them for protection.</span></p><h1><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">The Teachings of Shinsei</span></h1><p>AiR p.25</p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Shinsei, or “the Little Teacher,'' lived during the time of the divine siblings in the Emerald Empire. He shared his teachings with the first Emperor, and they were recorded in full to create the Teachings of Shinsei. Following the Teachings of Shinsei means acting in accordance with virtue and the harmony of the universe, which itself leads to order and the furtherance of good over evil. The Teachings of Shinsei is studied and debated by the Brotherhood of Shinsei, a vast collection of monastic orders, each with an individual approach to study and practice. While fanaticism exists within Shinseism, most people who practice it live its principles with stability.</span></p>",

Shinsei determined that the world was composed of the five elements: Air, Earth, Fire, Water, and the Void that holds the other elements together. These elements, also called rings, were represented in the sacred spirits of the land and the natural world, but also in society and in one’s psyche. Air is the weather and the wind, the invisible and the innuendo, and the swiftness of a bird of prey. Earth is stone, wood, and metal, as well as a donkey’s stubbornness and a tortoise’s patience. Fire is the gentle warmth of the sun or the rage of a wildfire, but also the spark of innovation, the passion of devotion, and the ferocity of a wildcat. Water is an octopus’s adaptability and flexibility; it takes the shape of its container, be it a puddle, river, or endless sea. Void is the emptiness of the night sky or nirvana, at once present and transcendent. </span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Many adventurers seek to hone these elemental qualities within themselves. They act as a reminder of the importance of balance and connection, two aspects that don’t come easily with a transient lifestyle. Learning to embody the elements requires intentional practice of their principles and meditation to internalize them. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Transience </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">All the universe comes from the Void, and all eventually return to it. The most important part of life is growth, as change is inevitable, and it might as well be positive transformation. Beauty and truth morph and must be admired in their many forms. Amidst the revolution, one can only find tranquility in being present. Becoming overly attached to anything leads to inexorable pain, and becoming mired in regret makes one lose sight of purpose and progression. Therefore, it is essential to live in the moment and ever consider the transitory nature of mortality. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Eternality </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Embracing the oneness of the five elements, or rings, and living in accordance with the principles of an ordered society could, according to Shinseism, enable one to transcend the cycle of rebirth and attain Enlightenment. Without Enlightenment, souls become trapped in the cyclical cosmos and continue to suffer mortal frailties. Over multiple lifetimes, many souls begin to seek a higher purpose and reach towards the Enlightenment necessary to shepherd them into ascension. </span></p><h2><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Fortune Favors Mortal Hands </span></h2><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">Despite the vast power of celestial beings, the fate of the Emerald Empire largely rests with its mortal inhabitants. This is the belief that inspired Togashi, founder of the Dragon Clan, to choose a mortal army as his weapon against Fu Leng. Mortals must chase their own destinies, and although supernatural guardians may sometimes offer assistance, history is clay in the hands of those who die and are reborn, not those who persist relatively unscathed.</span></p><h1>Fortunism</h1><p><span style=\"font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, 'Noto Sans', 'Liberation Sans', sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol', 'Noto Color Emoji'\">In Rokugan, the veneration of ancestral and nature spirits is known as Fortunism. Those who practice look to the Great Fortunes for safety and prosperity and also show reverence for gods of societal institutions and other beings of cosmic importance. Much of these teachings are in accordance with Shinseism. The wearing of charms is an important tradition of the Rokugani people, especially adventurers. On rare occasions, powerful spirits have even been known to bestow legendary charms upon those who serve them by accomplishing a specific task. These charms are individualized to the receiver.</span></p><p></p>",
